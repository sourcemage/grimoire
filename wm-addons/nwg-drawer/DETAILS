cat << EOF
Nwg-drawer is an application launcher. It's being developed with
sway and Hyprland in mind, but should also work with other
wlroots-based Wayland compositors.

The nwg-drawer command displays the application grid. The search
entry allows to look for installed applications, and for files in XDG
user directories. The grid view may also be filtered by categories.
