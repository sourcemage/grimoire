bbrun can be run in normal mode where it creates an icon that sits in the slit
you can then click on the picture of the gear to make the text entry window
popup.  You can also run bbrun in withdrawn mode by specifying the -w flag.
This is ideal for use with the key shortcut program bbkeys since it  will jump
straight to the text entry screen.  bbrun also supports the 'escape' and 
'enter' keys for those of you who like to use the mouse as little as possbile. 
bbrun keeps a history of your most recent commands.
