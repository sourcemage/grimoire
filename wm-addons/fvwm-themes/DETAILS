fvwm-themes gives to a novice fvwm user a complete fvwm configuration with
precreated themes. The user doesn't need to know any fvwm syntax to start using
a reasonably powerful and themeable fvwm setup. All he needs is to install the
latest fvwm, the latest fvwm-themes and start fvwm-themes-start. On the other
hand, fvwm-themes gives to a more experience user an ability to create his own
personal parts (so called personal theme) to use with other theme components or
even to create a completely new theme.
