cat << EOF
Pluggable, composable, unopinionated modules for building a Wayland compositor;
or about 50,000 lines of code you were going to write anyway.

  * wlroots provides backends that abstract the underlying display and input
hardware, including KMS/DRM, libinput, Wayland, X11, and headless backends,
plus any custom backends you choose to write, which can all be created or
destroyed at runtime and used in concert with each other.
  * wlroots provides unopinionated, mostly standalone implementations of many
Wayland interfaces, both from wayland.xml and various protocol extensions.
We also promote the standardization of portable extensions across many
compositors.
  * wlroots provides several powerful, standalone, and optional tools that
implement components common to many compositors, such as the arrangement of
outputs in physical space.
  * wlroots provides an Xwayland abstraction that allows you to have excellent
Xwayland support without worrying about writing your own X11 window manager on
top of writing your compositor.
  * wlroots provides a renderer abstraction that simple compositors can use to
avoid writing GL code directly, but which steps out of the way when your needs
demand custom rendering code.
