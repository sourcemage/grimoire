FVWM-Crystal aims to create an easy to use, eye-candy but also powerful desktop
environment for Linux or other Unix-like operating systems. It uses following
programs: FVWM as a window manager and "main core", ROX-Filer as file manager
(manages icons on the desktop), xterm, aterm, mrxvt or urxvt as terminal
emulators, MPD or XMMS as music players (there's built-in support for
controlling these programs), and several other tools for different functions,
like setting a wallpaper or making screen shots.
