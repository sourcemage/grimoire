UnixCW is a package of UNIX-based programs that fit together to form a CW
tutor program similar to CP222 by VU2ZAP.  The core of the package is cwlib,
a general-purpose CW functions library.  There are four programs in the
package built around this library: a simple Morse code sounding program; a
small random character generator; a curses-based Morse code tutor; and a
Qt-based (X windows) Morse code tutor.  The Qt-based tutor program offers
send practice as well as receive.  The package includes complete man pages.
