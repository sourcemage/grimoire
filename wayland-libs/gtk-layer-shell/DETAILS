A library to write GTK applications that use Layer Shell.
Layer Shell is a Wayland protocol for desktop shell components, such as panels,
notifications and wallpapers. You can use it to anchor your windows
to a corner or edge of the output, or stretch them across the entire output.
It supports all Layer Shell features including popups and
popovers (GTK popups Just Workâ„¢). This Library is compatible with C, C++ and
any language that supports GObject introspection files
(Python, Vala, etc).

This library only works on Wayland, and only on Wayland compositors
that support the Layer Shell protocol. Layer shell is supported on:

    wlroots based compositors (such as Sway, hyprland, etc.)
    Mir-based compositors (some may not enable the protocol by default
	and require --add-wayland-extension zwlr_layer_shell_v1)

Layer shell is not supported on:

    Gnome-on-Wayland
    Any X11 desktop
