ngspice is the open source spice simulator for electric and electronic
circuits.

Such a circuit may comprise of JFETs, bipolar and MOS transistors, passive
elements like R, L, or C, diodes, transmission lines and other devices,
all interconnected in a netlist. Digital circuits are simulated as well,
event driven and fast, from single gates to complex circuits. And you may
enter the combination of both analog and digital as a mixed-signal circuit.

ngspice offers a wealth of device models for active, passive, analog, and
digital elements. Model parameters are provided by our collections, by the
semiconductor device manufacturers, or from semiconductor foundries. The
user adds her circuits as a netlist, and the output is one or more graphs of
currents, voltages and other electrical quantities or is saved in a data file.

ngspice does not provide schematic entry. Its input is command line or file
based. There are however third party interfaces available.

ngspice is SPICE compatible. You may apply PSPICE or LTSPICE device model
parameters and netlists for simulating discrete circuits. ngspice will also
read HSPICE device libraries from semiconductor foundry PDKs for simulating
integrated circuits.
