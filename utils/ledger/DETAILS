Ledger is an accounting tool with the moxie to exist.  It provides no
bells or whistles, and returns the user to the days before user
interfaces were even a twinkling in their father's CRT.

What it does do is to offer a double-entry accounting ledger with all
the flexibility and muscle of its modern day cousins, without any of
the fat.  Think of it as the Bran Muffin of accounting tools.
