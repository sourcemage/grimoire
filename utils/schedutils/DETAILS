cat << EOF
Scheduling Utils are a collection of tools related to realtime scheduling,
working much like 'nice' and 'renice', except they change the priority and
scheduler. This enables a process to run in soft realtime, as specified
by POSIX.1b.

When using the CFQ kernel scheduler: That means you can set the "I/O"
priority of a process so you can avoid that a process that does too much I/O
(daily updatedb) starves the rest of the system, or give extra priority to a
process that shouldn't be starved by other processes, by using the included
'ionice' tool.
