cat << EOF
AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment) is a file integrity
checker. It creates a database from the regular expression rules that it
finds from the config file. Once this database is initialized it
can be used to verify the integrity of the files. It has several 
message digest algorithms (md5,sha1,rmd160,tiger,haval,etc.) that 
are used to check the integrity of the file. More algorithms can 
be added with relative ease. All of the usual file attributes can 
also be checked for inconsistencies. It can read databases from older 
or newer versions.
