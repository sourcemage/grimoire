           SHORT="Improved version of NVIDIAs nvparse library"
cat << EOF
A library from nVIDIA; the original version of nvparse had some problems on 
Linux, so we have slightly modified it. It is strongly recommended 
that you download our version of nvparse and remove any other potentially 
conflicting versions of the same library.
