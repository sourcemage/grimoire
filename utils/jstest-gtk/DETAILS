jstest-gtk is a simple joystick tester based on Gtk+. It provides you with
a list of attached joysticks, a way to display which buttons and axis are
pressed, a way to remap axis and buttons and a way to calibrate your joystick.

Even when your joystick is working mostly fine, you might want to give it
a try, as the calibration lets you get rid of overlarge default deadzones
that many joysticks use and that are a a noticable problem in some games.
