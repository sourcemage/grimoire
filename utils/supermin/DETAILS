cat << EOF
Supermin is a tool for building supermin appliances. These are tiny appliances
(similar to virtual machines), usually around 100KB in size, which get fully
instantiated on-the-fly in a fraction of a second when you need to boot one of
them.

Originally "fe" in "febootstrap" stood for "Fedora", but this tool is now
distro-independent and can build supermin appliances for several popular Linux
distros, and adding support for others is reasonably easy. For this reason,
starting with version 4, we have renamed the tool "supermin".
