Gcal displays hybrid and proleptic Julian and Gregorian calendar
sheets, respectively, for one month, three months, or a whole year,
and also eternal holiday lists for many countries around the globe.
It features a very powerful creation of fixed date lists that can be
used for reminding purposes (i.e., it can display fixed dates on the
day on which they fall and remind the user about them either on
screen or by email), and calculate various astronomical data and
times of the Sun and the Moon for any location, precisely enough for
most purposes.
