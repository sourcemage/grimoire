daemontools is a collection of tools for managing UNIX services.

supervise monitors a service. It starts the service and restarts the
service if it dies. Setting up a new service is easy: all supervise
needs is a directory with a run script that runs the service.

multilog saves error messages to one or more logs. It optionally
timestamps each line and, for each log, includes or excludes lines
matching specified patterns. It automatically rotates logs to limit the
amount of disk space used. If the disk fills up, it pauses and tries
again, without losing any data.

This spell by default builds an "official" package, using DJB's required
installation paths and behaviors.  Options are provided to install to
FHS-compliant paths as well.
