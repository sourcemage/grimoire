cloc counts blank lines, comment lines, and physical lines of source
code in many programming languages. It is written entirely in Perl with
no dependencies outside the standard distribution of Perl v5.6 and higher
(code from some external modules is embedded within cloc) and so is quite
portable. cloc is known to run on many flavors of Linux, AIX, Solaris, IRIX,
z/OS, and Windows. (To run the Perl source version of cloc on Windows one
needs ActiveState Perl 5.6.1 or higher, or Cygwin installed. Alternatively
one can use the Windows binary of cloc generated with perl2exe to run on
Windows computers that have neither Perl nor Cygwin.)

cloc contains code from David Wheeler's SLOCCount, Damian Conway and Abigail's
Perl module Regexp::Common, and Sean M. Burke's Perl module Win32::Autoglob.
