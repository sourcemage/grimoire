CoreCtrl is a Free and Open Source GNU/Linux application that allows you
to control with ease your computer hardware using application profiles.
It aims to be flexible, comfortable and accessible to regular users.

There are already others GNU/Linux applications that allow you to control
your hardware. Some of them are pretty good. Most of them are not built with
regular users in mind and/or are focused on some specific hardware or features,
so usually you end up with multiple control programs installed and running at
the same time, each of them having its own specific configuration. Also, most
of them do not respond to external events other that the hardware events they
control so, if you want to change the behavior of the system for a given period
of time, let's say, during one specific program execution, you have to manually
interact with each control program in order to change its behavior, before and
after that specific program execution.

All of this is perceived by regular users as a big burden or even a barrier that
impedes them to migrate to GNU/Linux for some specific tasks (as gaming).
CoreCtrl aims to be a game changer in this particular field. You can use it
to automatically configure your system when a program is launched
(works for Windows applications too). It doesn't matter what the program is,
a game, a 3D modeling application, a video editor or... even a compiler!
It offers you full hardware control per application.
The actual version of CoreCtrl automatically apply profiles for native and
Windows applications, has basic CPU controls and full AMD GPUs controls
(for both old and new models). The goal is to support as much hardware
as possible, even from other vendors. Please, see Future work for more details.
