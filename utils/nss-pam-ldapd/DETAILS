cat << EOF
nss-pam-ldapd is Name Service Switch module and Pluggable Authentication Module
that allows your LDAP server to provide user account, group, host name, alias,
netgroup, and basically any other information that you would normally get from
/etc flat files or NIS. It also allows you to do authentication to LDAP server.

The NSS module is a fork from the nss_ldap package by PADL Software Pty Ltd..
This fork was done to implement some structural design changes. These changes
were needed because there are some issues with the original design.

The biggest advantages of nss-pam-ldapd are:

 * lighter NSS library
 * lighter PAM library
 * simpler internal semantics
 * clear separation between NSS, PAM and LDAP code (the server part could easily
   be implemented in another language)
 * less connections to the LDAP server
