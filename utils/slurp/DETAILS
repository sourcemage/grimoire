slurp is a command-line utility to select a region from Wayland compositors
which support the layer-shell protocol. It lets the user hold the pointer
to select, or click to cancel the selection.

If the standard input is not a TTY or the -r option is used, slurp will read
a list of predefined rectangles for quick selection. Each line must be in the
form "<x>,<y> <width>x<height> [label]". The label is optional and can be any
string that doesn't contain newlines. It can be accessed using the "%l" sequence
in a format string.

If the Esc key is pressed, selection is cancelled. If the Space key is held,
the selection is moved instead of being resized.
