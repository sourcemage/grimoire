Oyranos is a Colour Management System (CMS) on operating system level. It
allows applications and users to match predictably input device colours to
output device colours. To do so in a consistent manner, applications and
workflows need to support the Oyranos CMS.

Oyranos is based one the well established ICC standard and various other
specifications. System wide settings in Oyranos shall enshure consistency in a
portable fashion. Oyranos will provide in the future a Colour Matching Module
(CMM) framework. Users can then transparently select a desired colour engine.
