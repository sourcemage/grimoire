swhkd is a display protocol-independent hotkey daemon made in Rust.
swhkd uses an easy-to-use configuration system inspired by sxhkd so you can
easily add or remove hotkeys.

It also attempts to be a drop-in replacement for sxhkd, meaning your sxhkd
config file is also compatible with swhkd.

Because swhkd can be used anywhere, the same swhkd config can be used across
Xorg or Wayland desktops, and you can even use swhkd in a tty.
