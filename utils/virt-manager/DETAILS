The "Virtual Machine Manager" application (virt-manager for short package name)
is a desktop user interface for managing virtual machines. It presents a
summary view of running domains and their live performance & resource
utilization statistics. A detailed view presents graphs showing performance and
utilization over time. Ultimately it will allow creation of new domains, and
configuration & adjustment of a domain's resource allocation & virtual
hardware. Finally an embedded VNC client viewer presents a full graphical
console to the guest domain.

The application logic is written in Python, while the UI is constructed with
Glade and GTK+, based on mockups provided by UI interaction designers. The
libvirt Python bindings are used to interacting with the underlying hypervisor.
This enables the application to be written independent of any particular
hypervisor technology. Initially Xen was the primary platform supported,
however, since libvirt 0.2.0 and virt-manager 0.3.1 it is possible to manage
QEMU and KVM guests too. It is expected that support for additional hypervisors
/ virtualization products will expand even further over time as additional
libvirt drivers are written.
