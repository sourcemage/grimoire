The GNU Core Utilities are the basic file, shell and text manipulation
utilities of the GNU operating system. These are the core utilities which
are expected to exist on every operating system. Previously these
utilities were offered as three individual sets of GNU utilities,
fileutils, shellutils, and textutils. Those three have been combined into
a single set of utilities called the coreutils. It began as the union
of these revisions: fileutils-4.1.11, textutils-2.1, sh-utils-2.0.15.
Since then, there have been many improvements and bug fixes.

The programs that can be built with this package are:
  basename cat chgrp chmod chown chroot cksum comm cp csplit cut date dd
  df dir dircolors dirname du echo env expand expr factor false fmt fold
  ginstall groups head hostid hostname id join kill link ln logname ls
  md5sum mkdir mkfifo mknod mv nice nl nohup od paste pathchk pinky pr
  printenv printf ptx pwd readlink rm rmdir seq sha1sum shred sleep sort
  split stat stty su sum sync tac tail tee test touch tr true tsort tty
  uname unexpand uniq unlink uptime users vdir wc who whoami yes
