The littleutils are a collection of small but useful programs. These programs
include a duplicate file finder (repeats), image optimizers (opt-jpg, opt-png,
and opt-gif), file renaming utilities (lowercase and uppercase), archive
recompressors (to-bzip, to-7zip, and to-lzma), a tempfile utility (tempname),
text file cleanup utilities (notabs, notrails, and lreplace), some low-level
file query utilities (filesize, filedate, filemode, and filenode), plus others.
Web site administrators will find the image optimizers particularly useful,
while script writers will find some of the lower-level utilities more useful.
