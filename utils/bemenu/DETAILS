cat << EOF
bemenu is a dynamic menu for tty (using ncurses), X11 and Wayland, inspired by
dmenu.

It reads a list of newline-separated items from standard input and then
presents them as a list, where the user can select one or more of them. When
pressing carriage-return, the selected items are printed to standard output
(one per line) and bemenu exits.

Entering text will filter the items to those that match the input. If the
number of items exceeds the size of the list, the items will be paginated.

bemenu-run is a special-case invocation of bemenu, where the input is the list
of executables under PATH and the selected items are executed.
