Atop is an ASCII full-screen performance monitor similar to the command
top. For every interval (default 10 seconds), it shows system-level
activity related to the CPU, memory, swap, disks and network layers, and
it shows for every active process the CPU utilization in system and user
mode, the virtual and resident memory growth, priority, username, state,
and exit code. The process level activity is also shown for processes
which finished during the last interval (for this reason process
accounting is switched on), to get a complete overview about the
consumers of things such as CPU time. Atop only shows the active
system-resources and processes, and only shows the deviations since the
previous interval (e.g., the memory growth rather than total memory usage
per process).
