cat << EOF
IPMItool is a simple command-line interface to systems that support the
Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) specification. It provides
the ability to read the SDR and print sensor values, display the contents of
the SEL, print FRU information, read and set LAN configuration parameters,
perform remote chassis power control, and act as a serial over LAN client. It
can work with IPMI-over-LAN (both version 1.5 and 2.0) interfaces as well
as the system interface provided by a kernel driver such as OpenIPMI.
