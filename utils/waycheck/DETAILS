cat << EOF
Waycheck is a simple Qt6 application that displays all of the Wayland
protocols that your compositor supports, and all of the protocols that
it doesn't support. It can be used to compare protocol support between
compositors, or if you're working on your own compositor, to keep track of
which protocols you still need to implement.
