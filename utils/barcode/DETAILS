GNU-barcode is meant to solve most needs in barcode creation with a conventional
printer. It can create printouts for the conventional product-tagging standards:
UPC-A, UPC-E, EAN-13, EAN-8, ISBN, and several others. Output is generated as
either Postscript, Encapsulated Postscript, or PCL (other back-ends may be added
if needed). The package is released as both a library and a command-line
frontend, so that you can include barcode-generation into your application..
