clinfo is a simple command-line application that enumerates
all possible (known) properties of the OpenCL platform and devices
available on the system.

Inspired by AMD's program of the same name, it is coded in pure C
and it tries to output all possible information, including those
provided by platform-specific extensions, trying not to crash on
unsupported properties (e.g. 1.2 properties on 1.1 platforms).
