uptimed is an uptime record daemon keeping track of the highest uptimes
the system ever had. Instead of using a pid file to keep sessions apart
from each other, it uses the system boot time. Uptimed has the ability
to inform you of records and milestones though syslog and e-mail, and
comes with a console front end to parse the records, which can also
easily be used to show your records on your Web page.
