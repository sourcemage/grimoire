mdp stands for "Mot de Passe", which means "password" in French.

It wraps GnuPG for encryption and deals with all the small details of
generating, managing, and fetching your passwords. It is similar to many other
programs, but differentiates itself with simplicity (not button-driven
simplicity, but with a Unix less-is-more style).

For example, beyond the use of GnuPG for encryption, it lets you use your own
editor to manage your passwords, categorize them, and delete them. In order to
avoid passwords lingering on your screen, the results from the queries are
displayed through a custom pager which is cleared after a customizable timeout.
