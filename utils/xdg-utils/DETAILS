Xdg-utils is a set of command line tools that assist applications with a 
variety of desktop integration tasks. About half of the tools focus on tasks 
commonly required during the installation of a desktop application and the 
other half focuses on integration with the desktop environment while the 
application is running. Even if the desktop components of your application are 
limited to an installer, configuration or management tool, Xdg-utils provides 
you with an easy way to enhance the usage experience of your customers by 
improving the integration of these components in the user's environment.
