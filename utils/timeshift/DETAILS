Timeshift for Linux is an application that provides functionality similar
to the System Restore feature in Windows and the Time Machine tool in Mac OS.
Timeshift protects your system by taking incremental snapshots of the file
system at regular intervals. These snapshots can be restored at a later date
to undo all changes to the system.

In RSYNC mode, snapshots are taken using rsync and hard-links. Common files
are shared between snapshots which saves disk space. Each snapshot is a full
system backup that can be browsed with a file manager.

In BTRFS mode, snapshots are taken using the in-built features of the
BTRFS filesystem. BTRFS snapshots are supported only on BTRFS systems having
an Ubuntu-type subvolume layout (with @ and @home subvolumes).

Timeshift is similar to applications like rsnapshot, BackInTime and TimeVault
but with different goals. It is designed to protect only system files
and settings. User files such as documents, pictures and music are excluded.
This ensures that your files remain unchanged when you restore your
system to an earlier date.
