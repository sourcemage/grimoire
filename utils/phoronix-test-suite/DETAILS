The Phoronix Test Suite is the most comprehensive testing and benchmarking
platform available for the Linux operating system. This software is designed to
effectively carry out both qualitative and quantitative benchmarks in a clean,
reproducible, and easy-to-use manner. This software is based upon the extensive
Linux benchmarking work and internal tools developed by Phoronix.com since 2004
along with input from leading tier-one computer hardware vendors. This software
is open-source and licensed under the GNU GPLv3. The Phoronix Test Suite
consists of a lightweight processing core (pts-core) with each benchmark
consisting of an XML-based profile with related resource scripts. The process
from the benchmark installation, to the actual benchmarking, to the parsing of
important hardware and software components is heavily automated and completely
repeatable, asking users only for confirmation of actions.

Features:
  * 70+ Test Profiles
  * 30+ Test Suites
  * Extensible (XML-based) Testing Architecture
  * Automated Test Installation
  * Dependency Management Support
  * Module-based Plug-In Architecture
  * Integrated Results Viewer
  * PNG & SVG Graph Rendering Support
  * Autonomous Batch Mode Supported
  * Global Database For Result Uploads, Benchmark Comparisons
  * HTML Documentation Covering Test Profiles, Module Framework
  * Installed Software, Hardware Detection
  * System Monitoring Support
  * Runs On Linux, OpenSolaris, Mac OS X, & FreeBSD Operating Systems
