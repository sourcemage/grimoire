Recoll is a personal full text search tool for Unix/Linux.

It is based on the very strong Xapian back-end, for which it provides a
feature-rich yet easy to use front-end with a Qt graphical interface.

- Easy installation, few dependancies.
- No database daemon, web server, desktop environment or
  exotic language necessary.
- Will run on most Unix-based systems
- Qt-based GUI. Can use either Qt 3
  or Qt 4.
- Searches most common document types, emails and their
  attachments.
- Powerful query facilities, with boolean searches, phrases,
  proximity, wildcards, filter on file types and directory tree.
- Multi-language and multi-character set with Unicode based
  internals.
