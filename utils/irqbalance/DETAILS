irqbalance is a Linux* daemon that distributes interrupts over the processors
and cores you have in your computer system. The design goal of irqbalance is
to do find a balance between power savings and optimal performance. To a large
degree, the work irqbalance does is invisible to you; if irqbalance performs
its job right, nobody will ever notice it's there or want to turn it off.
