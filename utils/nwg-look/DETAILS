Nwg-look is a GTK3 settings editor, designed to work properly in wlroots-based
Wayland environment. The look and feel is strongly influenced by LXAppearance,
but nwg-look is intended to free the user from a few inconveniences:

  * It works natively on Wayland. You no longer need Xwayland, nor strange
    env variables for it to run.
  * It applies gsettings directly, with no need to use workarounds.
    You don't need to set gsettings in the sway config file.
  * You don't need the import-gsettings script.
