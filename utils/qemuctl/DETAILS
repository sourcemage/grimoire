cat << EOF
This is a GUI for virtual pc emulator "qemu". But it is not for configuring
devices or starting qemu, no it is for changing media, reset the vm, making
screenshots, and so on. And this at runtime.

If you are a user of one of the configuring GUI's, just change the path to
qemu to qemuctl and it work.

So, if you are developing a configuring GUI for qemu and you want qemuctl
firing up with your GUI. This can just add a suspend screenshot to your
GUI like you would see in vmware, then launch qemuctl instead qemu. Now
qemuctl will do the job launching qemu. Now drop me a note and you are on
the supported configuring GUI's list.
