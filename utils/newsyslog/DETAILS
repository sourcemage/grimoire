All log files rotated by newsyslog are compressed, with the choice of either
gzip-style zlib compression or bzip2 compression. newsyslog also has the ability
to run an analyze program on the log file (usually useful to scan the log for
anomalous entries and report them, perhaps by sending a report in e-mail), and
to run a filter program on the log before archiving it and only archiving the
output from the filter (so that the uninteresting lines can be stripped out
before archiving). It also has the standard features that you'd expect in a log
rotation program, such as being able to save a given number of old copies of a
log and running commands to stop and start the service around the log rotation.
