Installwatch is a simple utility which keeps track of which files are 
created and modified during the installation of a new program. It's
fast and easy to use. It doesn't require a "pre-install" phase
because it monitors processes while they run. Installwatch works with 
every dynamically linked ELF program, by intercepting system calls
that cause file system alterations.
