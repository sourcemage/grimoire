REnouveau stands for Reverse Engineering for nouveau.

REnouveau requires the nVidia proprietary driver installed and working.

It is an application that runs small opengl tests and watches the changes in
the video card registers. Usage instructions are on the README file. It takes
some time to get into, but once you know it, it is simple to read.

This is used to do clean room reverse engineering (this is not in violation
with nvidia driver license). We do not disassemble binaries.
