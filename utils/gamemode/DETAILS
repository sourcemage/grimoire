GameMode is a daemon/lib combo for Linux that allows games to request a set of
optimisations be temporarily applied to the host OS and/or a game process.

GameMode was designed primarily as a stop-gap solution to problems with the
Intel and AMD CPU powersave or ondemand governors, but is now host to a
range of optimisation features and configurations.

Currently GameMode includes support for optimisations including:

    CPU governor
    I/O priority
    Process niceness
    Kernel scheduler (SCHED_ISO)
    Screensaver inhibiting
    GPU performance mode (NVIDIA and AMD), GPU overclocking (NVIDIA)
    Custom scripts
