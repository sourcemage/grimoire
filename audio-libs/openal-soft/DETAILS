OpenAL Soft is a cross-platform software implementation of the OpenAL 3D
audio API. It's built off of the open-sourced Windows version available
originally from the SVN repository at openal.org.

OpenAL provides capabilities for playing audio in a virtual 3d
environment. Distance attenuation, doppler shift, and directional sound
emitters are among the features handled by the API. More advanced effects,
including air absorption, low-pass filters, and reverb, are available through
the EFX extension. It also facilitates streaming audio, multi-channel buffers,
and audio capture.
