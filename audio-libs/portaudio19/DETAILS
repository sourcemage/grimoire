PortAudio is a free, cross platform, open-source, audio I/O library.
It lets you write simple audio programs in 'C' that will compile and
run on many platforms including Windows, Macintosh (8,9,X), Unix
(OSS), SGI, and BeOS. PortAudio is intended to promote the exchange
of audio synthesis software between developers on different
platforms, and was recently selected as the audio component of a
larger PortMusic project that includes MIDI and sound file support.
