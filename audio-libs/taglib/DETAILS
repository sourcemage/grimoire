TagLib, is well, a library for reading and editing audio meta data, commonly
know as tags.

Some goals of TagLib:
A clean, high level, C++ API to handling audio meta data.
Support for at least ID3v1, ID3v2 and Ogg Vorbis comments.
A generic, simple API for the most common tagging related functions.
Binary compatibility between minor releases using the standard KDE/Qt
techniques for C++ binary compatibility.
Make the tagging framework extensible by library users; i.e. it will be
possible for libarary users to implement additional ID3v2 frames, without
modifying the TagLib source (through the use of Abstract Factories and such.
