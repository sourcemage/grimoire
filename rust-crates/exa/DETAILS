cat << EOF
exa is a modern replacement for the venerable file-listing command-line
program ls that ships with Unix and Linux operating systems, giving it
more features and better defaults. It uses colours to distinguish file
types and metadata. It knows about symlinks, extended attributes, and Git.
And itâ€™s small, fast, and just one single binary.

By deliberately making some decisions differently, exa attempts to be a more
featureful, more user-friendly version of ls.
