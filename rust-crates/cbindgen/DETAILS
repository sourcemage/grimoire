This project can be used to generate C bindings for Rust code. It is currently
being developed to support creating bindings for WebRender, but has been
designed to support any project.

Features

  * Builds bindings for a crate, its mods, its dependent crates, and their mods
  * Only the necessary types for exposed functions are given bindings
  * Can specify annotations for controlling some aspects of binding
  * Support for generic structs and unions
  * Support for exporting constants and statics
  * Customizable formatting, can be used in C or C++ projects
  * Support for generating `#ifdef`'s for `#[cfg]` attributes
  * Support for `#[repr(sized)]` tagged enum's
