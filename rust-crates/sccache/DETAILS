sccache is a ccache-like compiler caching tool. It is used as a compiler
wrapper and avoids compilation when possible, storing cached results
either on local disk or in one of several cloud storage backends.

sccache includes support for caching the compilation of C/C++ code,
Rust, as well as NVIDIA's CUDA using nvcc.

sccache also provides icecream-style distributed compilation
(automatic packaging of local toolchains) for all supported
compilers (including Rust). The distributed compilation system includes
several security features that icecream lacks such as authentication,
transport layer encryption, and sandboxed compiler execution on build servers.
