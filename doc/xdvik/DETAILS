Xdvik is a program for displaying DVI files (generated e.g. by Troff or TeX)
on the X window system. It is based on the regular (non-k) xdvi of the same
version number. 
We try to track the changes in xdvi (possibly with some delay), so that any
version of xdvik has at least all the features of the 'regular' xdvi with the
same version number. For updates between xdvi releases, an additional
'patchlevel' number is used, e.g. 22.74.3 for patchlevel 3 of release 22.74.

Xdvik added some nice features like hyperref support...
