dvipng  ******   This program makes PNG and/or GIF graphics from DVI
files as obtained  from TeX and its relatives.  
   If GIF support is enabled, GIF output is chosen by using the 
`dvigif' binary or with the `--gif' option.  
   It is intended to produce anti-aliased screen-resolution images as 
fast as is possible. The target audience is people who need to generate
 and regenerate many images again and again. The primary target is the 
preview-latex (X)Emacs package, a package to preview formulas from  within
(X)Emacs. Yes, you get to see your formulas in the (X)Emacs  buffer, see
`http://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/preview-latex.html'.  
   Another example is WeBWorK, an internet-based method for delivering 
homework problems to students over the internet, giving students 
instant feedback as to whether or not their answers are correct, see 
`http://webwork.math.rochester.edu'.  
   A more recent addition to the dvipng-using applications out there is 
MediaWiki, the software behind Wikipedia and many other wikis out 
there. Dvipng is used to render mathematical formulae from version  1.8.0
of MediaWiki, see `http://www.mediawiki.org'.  
   Other applications may also benefit, like web applications as 
latex2html and WYSIWYG editors like LyX.   Benefits of dvipng 
==================  
   The benefits of `dvipng'/`dvigif' include 

   * Speed. It is a very fast bitmap-rendering code for DVI files, which 
     makes it suitable for generating large amounts of images  on-the-fly,
     as needed in preview-latex, WeBWorK and others. 

   * It does not read the postamble, so it can be started before TeX 
     finishes. There is a `--follow' switch that makes dvipng wait at 
     end-of-file for further output, unless it finds the POST marker  that
     indicates the end of the DVI. 

   * Interactive query of options. dvipng can read options interactively 
     through stdin, and all options are usable. It is even possible to 
     change the input file through this interface. 

   * Supports PK, VF, PostScript Type1, and TrueType fonts, subfonts 
     (i.e., as used in CJK-LaTeX), color specials, and inclusion of 
     PostScript, PNG, JPEG or GIF images. 

   * and more...
