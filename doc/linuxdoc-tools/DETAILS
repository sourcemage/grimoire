LinuxDoc is a kind of SGML DTD. It was created for the Linux HOWTOs,
and had been used officially by the Linux Documentation Project
(LDP).  Now LDP has aggressively migrated into the DocBook world, but
many documents are still available in LinuxDoc DTD sgml. So
users may still need the tool for LinuxDoc, therefore this tool set was
created on the basis of sgml-tools_v1.  The main command is linuxdoc,
but several other command is provided for users' convenience: sgmlcheck:
for syntax checking sgml2html: conversion to html sgml2info: conversion
to info sgml2latex: conversion to latex, dvi, and postscript sgml2lyx:
conversion to lyx sgml2rtf: conversion to rtf sgml2txt: conversion to
text HTML can be generated without any other Debian text processing
package, but for the other formats the appropriate packages will have
to be installed.  This linuxdoc-tools has been designed and implemented
only for linuxdoc DTD.
