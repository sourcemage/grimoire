catdoc is program which reads one or more Microsoft word files and outputs
text, contained insinde them to standard output. Therefore it does same
work for .doc files, as unix cat command for plain ASCII files.

It is now accompanied by xls2csv - program which converts Excel
spreadsheet into comma-separated value file

Optionaly, catdoc is able to translate some non-ASCII chars into
correspoindig TeX escape sequences and convert charsets from Windows ANSI
codepage to local codepage of target machine. (Becouse catdoc is russian
program, by default it converts cp1251 to koi8-r, when running under UNIX
and to cp866 when running under DOS.

Catdoc has rudimentary table handling. In TeX mode it inserts & when
encounters field delimiter and \\ when encounters end of table row. No
table headers are produced although.

Catdoc doesn't even try to preserver MS-Word character formatting. It's
goal is to extract plain text and allow you to read it and, probably,
reformat with TeX, according to TeXnical rules, most Word users haven't
even heard about.

xls2csv does roughly same for Excel files. It extracts data and leaves out
any formatting info and formulas. Concept is that you want to see data,
not the way it was created.
