cz2cz tools is software for converting texts between various charset
encodings that are used in the Czech language. The most important feature
is autodetection of the most-used encodings (ISO-8859-2, Win-1250, cp850,
and Kamenickych). There are both console non-interactive (text-based)
and interactive (curses) applications. cz2cz also allows you to convert
characters with diacritics to TeX (LaTeX) conventions. The interactive
part of cz2cz tools can be used for quick manual complementing of diacritics
to texts.
