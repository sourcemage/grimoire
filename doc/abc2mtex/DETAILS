abc is a language designed to notate tunes in an ascii format. It was
designed primarily for folk and traditional tunes of Western European origin
(such as English, Irish and Scottish) which can be written on one stave in
standard classical notation. However, it is extendible to many other types of
music and recently Steve Allen has coded [14]Beethoven's Symphony No. 7,
Movement 2 in abc! Since its introduction at the end of 1991 it has become very
popular and there now exist several PC and UNIX based tools which can read abc
notation and either process it into staff notation or play it through the
speakers of a computer.

One of the most important aims of abc notation, and perhaps one that
distinguishes it from most, if not all, computer-readable musical languages is
that it can be easily read by humans. In other words, with a little practice,
it is possible to play a tune directly from the abc notation without having to
process and print it out. Even if this isn't of interest, the resulting clarity
of the notation makes it fairly easy to notate tunes. In addition, the ability
to write music in abc notation means that it can be easily and portably stored
or transported electronically hence enabling the discussion and dissemination
of music via email.
