   html2text is a command line utility, written in C++, that converts
   HTML documents (HTML 3.2) into plain text (ISO 8859-1).
                                                                                
   Each HTML document is loaded from a location indicated by an URI or
   read from standard input, and formatted into a stream of plain text
   characters that is written to standard output or into an output-file.
   The input-URI may specify a remote site, from that the documents are
   loaded via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
   The program is even able to preserve the original positions of table
   fields and accepts also syntactically incorrect input, attempting to
   interpret it "reasonably". The rendering is largely customisable
   through an RC file.
                                                                                
   html2text is reported to work on Linux, SINIX and AIX, but should work
   on most other UNIX platforms as well, in particular those who provide
   a GNU compiler.
                                                                                
   html2text was written up to version 1.2.2 by Arno Unkrig for GMRS. As
   GMRS does not support this program any longer nor provides its source
   code any more, but agreed to change its licence terms, it is now
   published here under the terms of the GNU General Public License.
