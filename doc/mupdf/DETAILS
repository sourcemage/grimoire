The renderer in MuPDF is tailored for high quality anti-aliased graphics. It
renders text with metrics and spacing accurate to within fractions of a pixel
for the highest fidelity in reproducing the look of a printed page on screen.

MuPDF is also small, fast, and yet complete. We support PDF 1.7 with
transparency, encryption, hyperlinks, annotations, search and many other bells
and whistles. MuPDF can also read XPS documents (OpenXPS / ECMA-388),
EPUB and CBZ (Comic Book archive) files.
