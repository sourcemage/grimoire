Non-blocking Qt database framework
FutureSQL was in part inspired by Diesel, and provides a higher level of abstraction than QtSql.
Its features include non-blocking database access by default, relatively boilderplate-free queries,
automatic database migrations and simple mapping to objects.

In order to make FutureSQL's use of templates less confusing, FutureSQL uses C++20 concepts, and requires a C++20 compiler.
