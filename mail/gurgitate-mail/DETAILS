Gurgitate-mail is a mail filter. It has two major features going for it:

    * It's small and easy to use * It has configuration files in Ruby,
    which is approximately eight thousand times easier
to read and write than Procmail's line noise, and yet much more powerful. (I
have to admit, it was originally inspired by elm's old "filter" program,
which also had rules files with human-readable syntax.) The caveat with
"more powerful" is that it's even easier to shoot yourself in the foot,
because a rules file is just a bunch of code in a Real Programming Language.
