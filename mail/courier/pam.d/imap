# To use the authpam authentication module with imapd, you must
# configure your PAM library to authenticate the "imap" service.
# See your system documentation for information on how to configure your
# PAM services. In most cases, all you need to do is to install this file
# as /etc/pam.d/imapd, but check your system documentation to make sure.
