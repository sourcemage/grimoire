The Courier mail transfer agent (MTA) is an integrated mail/groupware server
based on open commodity protocols, such as ESMTP, IMAP, POP3, LDAP, SSL, and
HTTP.  Courier provides ESMTP, IMAP, POP3, webmail, and mailing list services
within a single, consistent, framework.  Individual components can be enabled
or disabled at will.  Courier now implements basic web-based calendaring and
scheduling services integrated in the webmail module.  Advanced groupware
calendaring services will follow soon.

Courier evolved out of several related projects, that merged together.
Courier implements SMTP extensions for mailing list management and spam
filtering.  Courier can function as an intermediate mail relay, relaying mail
between an internal LAN and the Internet, or perform final delivery to
mailboxes.  Courier uses maildirs as its native mail storage format, but it
can also deliver mail to legacy mailbox files as well.  Courier's
configuration is set by plain text files and Perl scripts.  Most of Courier's
configuration can now be adjusted from a web browser, using Courier's
web-based administration module.

Courier can provide mail services for regular operating system accounts.
Courier can also provide mail services for virtual mail accounts, managed by
an LDAP, MySQL, or PostgreSQL-based authentication database.
