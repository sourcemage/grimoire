The Block Sender plugin allows users to create a list of e-mail addresses that will be "blocked" from delivery. When an e-mail arrives for a user the sender's address is checked against their block list. If the sender's address is in the block list the mail will automatically be delivered to their SquirrelMail trash folder. Users can add addresses to their blocked list by reading an e-mail and clicking on the "Block Sender" link, which is added by this plugin. Users can also manually edit their blocked senders list through their SquirrelMail Options.
