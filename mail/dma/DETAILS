dma is a small Mail Transport Agent (MTA), designed for home and office use.
It accepts mails from locally installed Mail User Agents (MUA) and delivers
the mails either locally or to a remote destination. Remote delivery includes
several features like TLS/SSL support and SMTP authentication.

dma is not intended as a replacement for real, big MTAs like sendmail or
postfix. Consequently, dma does not listen on port 25 for incoming connections.
