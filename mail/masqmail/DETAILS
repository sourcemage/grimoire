Masqmail is a mail server designed for hosts that are not permanently connected
to the Internet. It handles outgoing messages, i.e. those that are to be sent
over the non-permanent link (usually a ppp or slip connection over a modem or
ISDN adapter) specially and delivers them only when explicitely told to do so.
There is support for multiple providers, it is possible to write different
configurations for each one. The configuration chosen is selected at delivery
time, so that if for example a delivery of a message failed while connected with
provider 1, it may be delivered when connected to provider 2. For each provider
another mail host (or none) can be specified.

Masqmail provides (a yet simple) mechanism to rewrite headers, also depending on
the current connection. This makes it possible to deliver messages with a return
address on the local network which will be rewitten at delivery time.

The purpose of this is:

- to allow delivery failure messages that are produced on the local network to
be delivered immediately, while those that are produced outside can be delivered
to a mailbox on the internet, to be retrieved later.

- to give mail servers a return address which they can accept if they check for
spam mail. Many mail servers require a return address which has the same domain
as the server it is getting the message from. If you normally connect to only
one provider, this is usually not a problem as you can configure your mailer to
a fixed address (but then there is still the problem with the failure messages),
but it is a problem if you use different ones from time to time.

Masqmail shall once be a complete replacement for sendmail (or other MTAs such
as exim, qmail or smail) on a local network, but it is NOT supposed to be
installed in a network with a permanent internet connection (at least if it is
not behind a secure firewall) because it has no ability to check for undesired
relaying or spam filtering.
