cat << EOF
fdm (fetch and deliver mail) is a simple, lightweight replacement for mail
fetching, filtering, and delivery programs such as fetchmail and procmail. It
can fetch using POP3, POP3S, IMAP, IMAPS, or stdin, and deliver to a pipe,
file, maildir, mbox, or SMTP server, based on a set of regexps. It can
be used for both single user and multiuser setups, and is designed with
privilege separation when running as root.
