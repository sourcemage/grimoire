cat << EOF
Instead of using pattern matching and a set of human generated rules SpamProbe
relies on a Bayesian analysis of the frequency of words used in spam and
non-spam emails received by an individual person. The process is completely
automatic and tailors itself to the kinds of emails that each person receives.
