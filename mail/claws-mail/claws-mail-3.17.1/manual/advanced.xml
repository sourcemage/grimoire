    <title>Actions</title>
    <para>
	Actions allow you to use all the power of the Unix command-line with 
	your emails. You can define various commands, taking parameters such 
	as the current email file, a list of emails, the currently selected 
	text, and so on. In this way, you'll be able to perform various tasks
	such as editing a raw mail in your text editor, 
	<emphasis>hide</emphasis> what you mean using ROT-13, apply patches 
	contained in emails directly, and so on. The only limit is your 
	imagination. You can create and configure Actions via the
	<quote>/Configuration/Actions...</quote> menu.
    </para>
    <para>
        The <quote>Tools/Actions/</quote> menu will contain one submenu
	item for each action that you have created. When you have selected
	one or more messages in the Message List, or are viewing a message
	in the Message View, selecting one of these menu items will invoke
	the action, and, depending on how it was defined, will pass the
	message(s) to it.
    </para>
    <para>
        Additionally, it is possible to add toolbar entries for your
        actions. To do so, open the <quote>Configuration/Preferences</quote>
        menu and select <quote>Toolbars/Main Window</quote>.
	Select <quote>User Action</quote> in the <quote>Item type</quote>
	dropdown menu, then select the Action in the <quote>Event executed on click</quote>
	dropdown menu, and click the <quote>Icon</quote> button to select the
	icon that you want to use.

  <section id="adv_templates">
    <title>Templates</title>
    <para>
	Templates are used in composition windows, and act as a model for 
	emails. Templates can be filled with static text and dynamic parts, 
	such as the original sender's name (<quote>Dear %N, ...</quote>), 
	the date, etc. When applying a template, the dynamic fields will be 
	replaced with the relevant values. You can configure templates via 
	the <quote>Tools</quote> menu.
    </para><para>
	When applying a template, you will be asked to <quote>Insert</quote>
	or <quote>Replace</quote>, the difference between replacing and 
	inserting is only concerned with the message body. 
	<quote>Replace</quote> will replace the current composition window 
	message body with the body defined in the template, clearing it if 
	the template body is empty. <quote>Insert</quote> will insert 
	the template's body, if set, at the current cursor position.
    </para><para>
	Whether you choose to Insert or Replace, any To, Cc or Bcc field 
	that is defined in the template will be appended to the compose 
	window's recipients list. If it is defined, the template's Subject 
	will always replace the compose window's Subject.
    </para><para>
	Symbols can be used in all parts of the templates and will be 
	substituted with their respective dynamic value if possible, otherwise 
	no value will be used. This often makes more sense if you apply a 
	template when replying or forwarding, otherwise most of the symbols 
	value will be undefined. There is no restriction on which symbols can 
	be used in template parts, even if inserting the body (%M or %Q) may 
	make no sense in common situations.
    </para><para>
	When applying a template, the body is processed first, then the To, Cc,
	Bcc and Subject fields follow.
    </para><para>
	Further information and examples of usage can be found in the 
	user-contributed FAQ on the Claws Mail website <ulink 
	url="http://www.claws-mail.org/faq/"

  <section id="adv_processing">
    <title>Processing</title>
    <para>
	Processing rules are the same as Filtering rules, except that they are 
	applied when entering a folder or when manually applied from a folder's
	context	menu and apply only	to this folder. You can use them to automatically
	move old mails into an archive folder, or for further dispatching of
	emails, and more. You can set each folder's Processing rules by
	right-clicking on it.
    </para><para>
	Processing rules are accompanied by Pre-processing and Post-processing 
	rules. Like Processing rules, they apply when opening a folder or manually
	applying them from a folder's context menu, but like Filtering rules,
	they are shared across all folders. You can configure them from the
	<quote>Tools</quote> menu. Pre-processing rules are executed before the
	folder's specific Processing rules, while Post-processing rules are executed
	afterwards.

  <section id="adv_colour_labels">
    <title>Colour Labels</title>
    <para>
	Colour labels can be used to denote a message as having a particular 
	significance. To set a colour label simply right-click a message in the
	Message List and use the <quote>Color label</quote> submenu.
    </para><para>
	Colour labels are user-configurable. Both the colour and the label can 
	be set by the user. Preferences can be found on the 
	<quote>Configuration/Preferences/Display/Colors</quote> page.
    </para>
  </section>
  <section id="adv_tags">
    <title>Tags</title>
    <para>
	Tags are short text notes which may be set on messages. They are useful
	for classifying messages with your own words. These tags can be used
	later to find the mails with Quick Search or to manage them with
	filtering or processing rules, for example.
    </para><para>
	Tagged messages are displayed with a yellow background at the top of
	the Message View. This line shows all tags associated with the
	message. You can enable the "Tags" column in the Message List, so
	tagged items can be seen without having to open the message.
    </para><para>
	Setting of tags is done by right-clicking on the message in the Message
	List or by the corresponding option in Message menu. A panel with the
	existing tags is shown and you can select some of them or just add a
	new one. Removal of existing tags is also allowed, of course.
    </para><para>
	Once tags exist it's even easier, as the context menu allows you to
	set and unset tags with just one click to the selected messages.
	Mixed selections of tagged and untagged messages are allowed, and
	Claws Mail is clever enough to do what you want to do in any case.

    <title>Mailing-List support</title>
    <para>
	Claws Mail offers mailing-list support from the 
	<quote>Message/Mailing-List/</quote> submenu. When you have a 
	mailing-list message selected, the submenu allows you to quickly 
	initiate subscribing, unsubscribing, posting, getting help, contacting 
	the list owner, and viewing the list archive; either by opening a new 
	Compose window with the appropriate address pre-filled, or by opening 
	the URL in your web browser.

  <section id="adv_plugins">
    <title>Plugins</title>
    <para>
	Plugins are the mechanism for extending Claws Mail' capabilities. 
	For example, imagine that you want to store your mails in a remote 
	<acronym>SQL</acronym> database. In most mailers out there this is 
	simply impossible without reworking the internals of the mailer. With 
	Claws Mail you can simply write a plugin to achieve the task.
    </para><para>
	This is just an example of the possibilities. A good number of plugins 
	developed for Claws Mail already exist, and more are to come. The 
	<link linkend="ch_plugins">Extending Claws Mail section</link> 
	gives details of them.

  <section id="deploying">
    <title>Deploying Claws Mail</title>
    <para>
	The initial configuration wizard tries to guess various fields using 
	information gathered from the system, such as username, hostname, and 
	more. As it is oriented towards general use, the default values often 
	have to be fixed. However, this wizard is customisable, in a manner 
	designed to allow system administrators to deploy Claws Mail easily
	over various users of one machine, or even over multiple machines 
	installed via some replication tool.
    </para><para>
	The first part consists of creating a wizard configuration template 
	and setting the various default parameters of a new Claws Mail 
	installation.
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
	Start with a user who does not have a <filename class="directory"
	>~/.claws-mail</filename> directory, ideally a new user.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	Start Claws Mail and go through the wizard. The values you fill in 
	will be of no use for the future deployment, so you can click 
	next-next-next.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
	Once the wizard is finished and you have Claws Mail' main window 
	opened, configure the various defaults you want to have in the master. 
	You can load plugins, add people or LDAP servers in the addressbook, 
	create filtering rules, and so on.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	If needed, and if the deployed Claws Mail will use MH folders, you 
	can create subdirectories in the mailbox.

	Next, quit Claws Mail.

      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	Now, edit the newly created wizard template file, 
	<filename>~/.claws-mail/accountrc.tmpl</filename>. In this file, 
	you will see different variables, corresponding to the wizard's fields.
	You can leave some commented, in which case the usual default will be 
	used, or specify values or variables. Not all fields can contain 
	variables; for example, <literal>smtpauth</literal>, 
	<literal>smtpssl</literal> and <literal>recvssl</literal> are booleans,
	either 0 or 1, and <literal>recvtype</literal> is an integer value. The
	other fields, like <literal>name</literal>, <literal>email</literal>, 
	or <literal>recvuser</literal>, are parsed by the wizard and the 
	variables they contain are replaced by values. This allows you to 
	specify everything as needed for your site, even if you have strange 
	server names or server logins.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	Save this file, and delete both 
	<filename>~/.claws-mail/accountrc</filename>, (which contains your 
	dummy account) and

	folder tree will be correctly parsed for new users). Recursively copy 
	<filename class="directory">.claws-mail</filename> to 
	<filename class="directory">/etc/skel/</filename>; if the deployed 
	Claws Mail will use MH folders, also copy the created 
	<filename class="directory">Mail</filename> directory. chown all of 
	<filename class="directory">/etc/skel/.claws-mail</filename> 
	and <filename class="directory">/etc/skel/Mail</filename> to 
	<literal>root:root</literal> for security reasons.

    is too high. You should probably set this value higher than your
    mail check interval. Otherwise the cache will always be freed between
    checks even if the folder is accessed on every check, which will cause
    much disk I/O. Default value is '15'.

	Claws Mail allows setting the Face and X-Face headers directly

	<filename>~/.claws-mail/autofaces/</filename> directory.
    </para>
    <para>
	If they exist, the global Face and/or X-Face headers for all
	accounts are taken from the <filename>face</filename> and/or
	<filename>xface</filename> files respectively. In a similar
	manner, Face and/or X-Face headers for a specific account can
	be provided by <filename>face.</filename><emphasis>accountname</emphasis>
	and/or <filename>xface.</filename><emphasis>accountname</emphasis>,
	where <emphasis>accountname</emphasis> is the name of the account you 
	want this header to be associated with.
   </para>
   <para>
	If the name of the account contains characters which may be unsuitable 
	for the underlying filesystem (including spaces) these are replaced by 
	underscores (<quote>_</quote>) when searching for the autofaces of 
	that account. For example, if your account is called 
	<quote>&lt;My Mail&gt;</quote>, the name for the X-Face filename for
	that account would be
	<filename>~/.claws-mail/autofaces/xface._My_Mail_</filename>.
	Be aware that this feature doesn't check the content of the files,
	or for duplication of headers, (most mailers, including Claws 
	Mail, will ignore duplicates and display the last one only).
