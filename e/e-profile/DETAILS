cat << EOF
The Enlightenment R17 Project covers more than simple window management. It
provides advanced graphical libraries, tools, and environments. Currently, the
project is made up of three different components: Enlightenment DR16, The
Enlightenment Foundation Libraries, and Enlightenment DR17. This profile is for
the latter two.
