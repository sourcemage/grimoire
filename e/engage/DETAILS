Engage is an application that takes a new approach to handling your iconbars,
icon boxes and panels. All you need to know about your applications is now in
one convenient location. It can launch applications, notify if applications are
running, contain the icons of iconified windows and maintain a "system tray"
for applications supporting the standard. Another feature is that it can embed
other "edje" files such as the clocks pictured below. Engage really is the tidy
way to manage all of your applications.
