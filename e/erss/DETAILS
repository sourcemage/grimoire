eRSS is a simple tool for watching RSS v1 (RDF) and v2 (XML) feeds. By creating
simple config files you can definate how each feed is monitored, by including a
clock, spedifying what information is displayed, the feed title, and how often
its updated. Feeds can be displayed either bordered (a conventional window) or
borderless for embedding in your desktop (pictured below). Each feed is its own
proccess allowing you to start and stop different feeds individually.
