cat << EOF
Exhibit is an image viewer that uses Etk as its toolkit. Exhibit supports
image previews for image types supported by Evas and allows for each
directory changing using a point and click interface or a text input box with
tab autocompletion support. Common operations include zooming in and out,
rotation, resizing, and moving around of images on the filesystem. Other
features include drag and drop and image sorting.
