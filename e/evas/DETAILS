Evas is a hardware-accelerated canvas API for X-Windows that can draw
anti-aliased text, smooth super and sub-sampled images, alpha-blend, as well as
drop down to using normal X11 primitives such as pixmaps, lines and rectangles
for speed if your CPU or graphics hardware are too slow.

Evas abstracts any need to know much about what the characteristics of your
XServer's display are, what depth or what magic visuals etc, it has. The most
you need to tell Evas is how many colors (at a maximum) to use if the display
is not a truecolor display. By default it is suggested to use 216 colors (as
this equates to a 6x6x6 color cube - exactly the same color cube Netscape,
Mozilla, gdkrgb etc. use so colors will be shared). If Evas can't allocate
enough colors it keeps reducing the size of the color cube until it reaches
plain black and white. This way, it can display on anything from a black and
white only terminal to 16 color VGA to 256 color and all the way up through 15,
16, 24 and 32bit color. Here are some screen shots of a demo Evas application
to show the rendering output in different situations.
