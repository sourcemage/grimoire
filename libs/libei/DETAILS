libei is a library for Emulated Input, primarily aimed at the Wayland
stack. It provides three parts:

EI (Emulated Input) for the client side (libei)

EIS (Emulated Input Server) for the server side (libeis)

oeffis is an optional helper library for DBus communication with the
XDG RemoteDesktop portal (liboeffis)

The communication between these parts is an implementation detail, neither
client nor server need to care about the details. Let's call it the BRidge
for EI, or brei. In the future, brei may become a stable protocol. For
now, this C library is it.
