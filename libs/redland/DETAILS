cat << EOF
Redland is a library that provides a high-level interface for RDF allowing the
RDF graph to be parsed from XML, stored, queried and manipulated. Redland
implements each of the RDF concepts in its own class via an object based API,
reflected into the other language APIs - Java, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby and Tcl.
Some of the classes providing the parsers, storage mechanisms and other
elements are built as modules that can be added or removed as required.
