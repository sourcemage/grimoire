cat << EOF
libwps is a library for importing the Microsoft Works word processor file 
format. As of December 2006, the project is new, but it imports Works format
versions 2, 3, 4, 5 (aka 2000), and 8 with some formatting. The scope of this 
project is just a Works word processor import filter, so there are no plans for
supporting an export filter, spreadsheets, or databases.
