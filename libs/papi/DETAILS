PAPI provides the tool designer and application engineer with a consistent
interface and methodology for use of the performance counter hardware found
in most major microprocessors. PAPI enables software engineers to see, in
near real time, the relation between software performance and processor events.

In addition, PAPI provides access to a collection of components that expose
performance measurement opportunites across the hardware and software stack.
