The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is a modern numerical library for C
and C++ programmers.  The routines have been written from scratch over
a five year period by the GSL team using modern coding
conventions. The complete range of subject areas covered by the
library includes, Complex Numbers Roots of Polynomials Special
Functions Vectors and Matrices Permutations Sorting BLAS Support
Linear Algebra Eigensystems Fast Fourier Transforms Quadrature Random
Numbers Quasi-Random Sequences Random Distributions Statistics
Histograms N-Tuples Monte Carlo Integration Simulated Annealing
Differential Equations Interpolation Numerical Differentiation
Chebyshev Approximation Series Acceleration Discrete Hankel Transforms
Root-Finding Minimization Least-Squares Fitting Physical Constants
IEEE Floating-Point.

Unlike the licenses of proprietary numerical libraries the license of
GSL does not restrict scientific cooperation.  It allows you to share
your programs freely with others.
