Eclipse Mosquitto is an open source (EPL/EDL licensed) message broker that
implements the MQTT protocol versions 5.0, 3.1.1 and 3.1. Mosquitto is
lightweight and is suitable for use on all devices from low power single
board computers to full servers.

The MQTT protocol provides a lightweight method of carrying out messaging
using a publish/subscribe model. This makes it suitable for Internet of Things
messaging such as with low power sensors or mobile devices such as phones,
embedded computers or microcontrollers.

The Mosquitto project also provides a C library for implementing MQTT clients,
and the very popular mosquitto_pub and mosquitto_sub command line MQTT clients.
