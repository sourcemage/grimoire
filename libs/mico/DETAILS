cat << EOF
The Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) was first published
in 1990 by the Object Management Group (OMG), a non-profit organisation that
was founded in 1989 to integrate distributed applications based on a variety
of existing technologies. CORBA standardises interfaces and semantics for
object-oriented middleware. It includes a specification for the Object Request
Broker (ORB), a software library with standardised CORBA object interfaces
that allows clients and targets to communicate with each other across a
network in a well-defined way. In addition, CORBA automatically applies a
range of useful services to communications. After the ORB is initialised,
all CORBA objects can be invoked by applications like local software objects.

MICO implements the CORBA standard. Since its foundation in December 1996,
MICO has become a mature, very stable, fully-compliant implementation of
the CORBA standard.

MICO is available as open source under the GNU-copyright notice and is widely
used for different purposes (see our success stories). In June 1999, MICO
has been branded as "CORBA compliant" by the OpenGroup, thus demonstrating
that it is production grade software.
