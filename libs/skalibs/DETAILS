skalibs is a package centralizing the free software / open source C development
files used for building all software at skarnet.org: it contains essentially
general-purpose libraries. You will need to install skalibs if you plan to
build skarnet.org software. The point is that you won't have to download and
compile big libraries, and care about portability issues, everytime you need
to build a package: do it only once.

skalibs can also be used as a sound basic start for C development. There
are a lot of general-purpose libraries out there; but if your main goal
is to produce small and secure C code with a focus on system programming,
skalibs might be for you.
