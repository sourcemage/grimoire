The overall goal of this project is to make an open source implementation of the 
Object Exchange (OBEX) protocol. OBEX is a session protocol and can best be described as a 
binary HTTP protocol. OBEX is optimised for ad-hoc wireless links and can be used to exchange all kind 
of objects like files, pictures, calendar entries (vCal) and business cards (vCard).
 OBEX was specified by the IrDATM (Infrared Data Association), and although the protocol is very good 
for Infrared connections, it is not limited to it. In fact OBEX does not specify the top or bottom API 
making it very flexible and can run over most transports like TCP/IP and Bluetooth. Therefore OBEX is 
also called IrOBEX when used over the Infrared medium. There are some transport modules for serial 
links (cable OBEX) too.
