The Time Zone Database (often called tz or zoneinfo) contains code and data
that represent the history of local time for many representative locations
around the globe. It is updated periodically to reflect changes made by
political bodies to time zone boundaries, UTC offsets, and daylight-saving
rules. Its management procedure is documented in BCP 175: Procedures for
Maintaining the Time Zone Database.
