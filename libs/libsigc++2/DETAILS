cat << EOF
Libsigc++ implements a full callback system for use in widget libraries,
abstract interfaces, and general programming. Originally part of the Gtk--
widget set, libsigc++ is now a seperate library to provide for more general
use. It is the most complete library of its kind with the ablity to connect
an abstract callback to a class method, function, or function object. It
contains adaptor classes for connection of dissimilar callbacks and has an
ease of use unmatched by other C++ callback libraries. Libsigc++ is licensed
