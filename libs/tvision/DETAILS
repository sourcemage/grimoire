cat << EOF
Turbo Vision is a C++ library that provides a very nice user interface for
console applications. This UNIX port is based on Borland's version 2.0 with
fixes. It was made to create RHIDE, a nice IDE for gcc and other GNU compilers.
The library supports /dev/vcsa devices for fast access to local consoles, and
it uses ncurses to run from telnet and xterm.
