XMLTV is a set of utilities to manage your TV viewing. They work with
TV listings stored in the XMLTV format, which is based on XML. The idea
is to separate out the backend (getting the listings) from the frontend
(displaying them for the user), and to implement useful operations like
picking out your favourite programmes as filters that read and write
XML documents.

At present there are backends grabbing TV listings for Canada, the
USA, the UK, Germany, Austria, Finland, New Zealand, Spain, Italy,
the Netherlands, Hungary, and Denmark.
