GNU Portable Threads (Pth) is a very portable POSIX/ANSI-C based library
for Unix platforms providing non-preemptive priority-based scheduling
for multiple threads of execution ("multithreading") inside server
applications. All threads run in the same address space, but each thread has
its own individual program-counter, run-time stack, signal mask and errno
variable. The scheduling is done in a cooperative way, i.e. the threads are
dispatched based on priority and pending events.
