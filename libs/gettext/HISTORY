2005-04-07 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* INSTALL: Don't use spell_ok since that doesn't take into account
	  optional_depends
	  Use a grep to check the optional_depends g++ flags and then take
	  action
	  Also remove ${INSTALL_ROOT}/usr/local/include/autosprintf.h if we
	  don't want g++
	  Bug #8573

	* CONFIGURE: Query for usage of tetex
	* DEPENDS: Use config_query and if/fi to use tetex only if they want,
	  not just if it's installed (so I can test gettext without g++, since
	  tetex needs g++ [Bug #8319])
	* PRE_BUILD,g++.patch.bz2: Removed, no longer needed (and doesn't
	  apply ;))
	* BUILD,INSTALL: Only use tetex if the user wants, not if it's installed

	* PRE_BUILD: Apply g++.patch if g++ isn't ok (via spell_ok)
	* g++.patch: Remove c++/g++/CXX so that gettext doesn't need it. What
	  a mess, if anyone has a better method, please feel free to clean
	  up my shenanigans.

	* DETAILS: added BUILD_API=2
	* BUILD: removed section belonging in INSTALL
	* INSTALL: move from BUILD into here and added moving
	  autosprintf.h to /usr/include since it was still
