The Portable Hardware Locality (hwloc) software package provides a portable abstraction (across OS, 
versions, architectures, ...) of the hierarchical topology of modern architectures, including NUMA 
memory nodes (DRAM, HBM, non-volatile memory, CXL, etc.), processor packages, shared caches, cores 
and simultaneous multithreading. It also gathers various system attributes such as cache and memory 
information as well as the locality of I/O devices such as network interfaces, InfiniBand HCAs or 
GPUs.
