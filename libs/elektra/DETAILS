cat << EOF
Elektra is a universal hierarchical configuration store, with related goals
like GConf and the Windows Registry. It allows programs to read and save their
configurations with a consistent API, and allows them to be aware of other
applications' configurations, leveraging easy application integration. The
whole point of it is to tie applications together, so that they can co-operate
and share their user-preferences.

The developers are associated to unix philosophy and the very practical point
consists of writing a configuration library. Every software needs this
functionality, it is not easy to do it right and performant and we want to
avoid any unnecessary code duplication.
