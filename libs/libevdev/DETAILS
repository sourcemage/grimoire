cat << EOF
ibevdev is a wrapper library for evdev devices. it moves the common tasks when dealing with evdev 
devices into a library and provides a library interface to the callers, thus avoiding erroneous 
ioctls, etc.
The eventual goal is that libevdev wraps all ioctls available to evdev devices, thus making 
direct access unnecessary.
