cat << EOF
It's often useful to be able to make real-mode x86 BIOS calls from userland.
lrmi provides a simple interface to this for x86 machines, but this doesn't help
on other platforms. libx86 provides the lrmi interface, but will also run on
platforms such as amd64 and alpha.

libx86 is built on top of two bodies of code - lrmi and x86emu. x86emu is
a generic x86 emulator originally provided by Scitech and now maintained as
part of the X.org distribution.

On x86 platforms, libx86 will use the vm86 interface provided by most modern
kernels in order to execute code. On non-x86 platforms, an interface layer
is provided to allow x86emu to be used to execute lrmi function calls. The
API is identical in both cases, meaning that applications can be written
without having to care about what's going on behind the scenes.
