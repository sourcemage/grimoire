GNUmp is a library operating on signed integers, rational numbers, and floating
point numbers. All functions have a standardized interface. GNUmp is designed to
be as fast as possible by using fullwords as the basic arithmetic type, by using
fast algorithms, by carefully optimizing assembly code for the most common inner
loops for many CPUs, and by a general emphasis on speed (as opposed to
simplicity or elegance). GNUmp's speed advantage increases with the operand
size, since GNUmp in many cases has asymptomatically faster algorithms.
