CLBlast is a lightweight, performant and tunable OpenCL BLAS
library written in C++11. It is designed to leverage the full
performance potential of a wide variety of OpenCL devices from
different vendors, including desktop and laptop GPUs, embedded GPUs,
and other accelerators. CLBlast implements BLAS routines: basic linear
algebra subprograms operating on vectors and matrices.
