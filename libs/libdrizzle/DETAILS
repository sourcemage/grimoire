This is the the client and protocol library for the Drizzle project. The
server, drizzled, will
use this as for the protocol library, as well as the client utilities and
any new projects that
require low-level protocol communication (like proxies). Other language
interfaces (PHP
extensions, SWIG, ...) should be built off of this interface.
