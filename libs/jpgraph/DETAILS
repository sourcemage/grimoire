cat << EOF
JpGraph is a fully OO graph library which makes it easy to both
draw a "quick and dirty" graph with a minimum of code and quite complex
graphs which requires a very fine grain of control. The library tries
to assign sensible default values for most parameters hence making the
learning curve quite flat since for most of the time very few commands
is required to draw graphs with a pleasing aesthetic look.
