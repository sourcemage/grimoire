libdeflate is a library for fast, whole-buffer DEFLATE-based compression and
decompression.

The supported formats are:

* DEFLATE (raw)
* zlib (a.k.a. DEFLATE with a zlib wrapper)
* gzip (a.k.a. DEFLATE with a gzip wrapper)

libdeflate is heavily optimized. It is significantly faster than the zlib
library, both for compression and decompression, and especially on x86
processors. In addition, libdeflate provides optional high compression modes
that provide a better compression ratio than the zlib's "level 9".

* libdeflate itself is a library. The following command-line programs which
  use this library are also included:
* libdeflate-gzip, a program which can be a drop-in replacement for standard
  gzip under some circumstances. Note that libdeflate-gzip has some
  limitations; it is provided for convenience and is not meant to be the main
  use case of libdeflate. It needs a lot of memory to process large files, and
  it omits support for some infrequently-used options of GNU gzip.
* benchmark, a test program that does round-trip compression and decompression
  of the provided data, and measures the compression and decompression speed.
  It can use libdeflate, zlib, or a combination of the two.
* checksum, a test program that checksums the provided data with Adler-32
  or CRC-32, and optionally measures the speed. It can use libdeflate or zlib.
