cat << EOF
PyEnchant is a set of language bindings and some wrapper classes to make the
excellent Enchant spellchecker available as a Python module. The bindings are
created using ctypes. It includes all the functionality of Enchant with the
flexibility of Python and a nice "Pythonic" object-oriented interface. It also
aims to provide some higher-level functionality than is available in the C API.
