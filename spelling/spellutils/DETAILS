Spellutils is a suite of programs which are used to isolate some parts or
texts from various types of files and hand them over to another
program which may change the texts; it is typically a spell checker.
Afterwards the possibly changed text parts are copied back in place in
the original file.                                                           

The programs in the Spellutils package are:                                  
  * newsbody which can isolate your own text from headers, quotes and        
    signature in e-mail or Usenet messages                                   
  * pospell which can isolate translations in .po files
