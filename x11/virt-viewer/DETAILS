cat << EOF
The "Virtual Machine Viewer" application (virt-viewer for short package name)
is a lightweight interface for interacting with the graphical display of
virtualized guest OS. It uses GTK-VNC as its display capability, and libvirt to
lookup the VNC server details associated with the guest. It is intended as a
replacement for the traditional vncviewer client, since the latter does not
support SSL/TLS encryption of x509 certificate authentication.
