cat << EOF
This tool is a simple "run-program" window, something like "xrun" or
"gnome-run". However, those other tools don't have some nice and
important features: the very useful feature that allows one to use it
with keyboard only, and to be fast enough.

The features there are pretty nice, such as it supports URLs,
completion from history, TAB completion for files on the local filesystem,
etc.
