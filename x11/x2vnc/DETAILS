cat << EOF
This program will let you use two monitors on two different computers as if
they were connected to the same computer, even if one of the computers runs 
Windows 95/98/NT and the other one runs X-windows.

It's like having two video cards in one computer, except with two computers 
with potentially different operating systems.
