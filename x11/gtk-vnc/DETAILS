cat << EOF
gtk-vnc is a VNC viewer widget for GTK.

It provides a core library written in C, using coroutines to allow it to be
completely asynchronous while remaining single threaded. A wrapper library
using PyGTK provides access to the widget functionality from Python. Two
example programs illustrate use of the widget by re-implementing the
traditional 'vncviewer' in a few 10's of lines of code.

The client is fully IPv6 aware, and as well as the traditional VNC
authentication protocol, implements the VeNCrypt extension to provide secure
TLS/SSL encrypted communications, optionally using x509 certificates to
authenticate.

Some applications using GTK VNC include:
  * Vinagre - John Wendell's general purpose VNC client application for the
    GNOME project
  * Virtual Machine Manager - GUI for managing Xen, QEMU and KVM virtual
    machines
  * KVM Test - Virtualized OS install automation with KVM
