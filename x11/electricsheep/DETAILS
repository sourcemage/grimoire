This software owes its name to Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep. 
It realizes the collective dream of sleeping computers from all over the internet.
When the screen-saver is activated, the screen goes black and an animated 'sheep' appears. 
Behind the scenes, the screen-saver contacts a server and joins the parallel computation of new sheep.
Every fifteen minutes 24/7 a new sheep is born and distributed to all clients for display. 
Each sheep is an animated fractal flame.
The Interpretation of Dreams contains an artistic, conceptual, and technical explanation.
