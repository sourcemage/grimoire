cat << EOF
cdlabelgen generates frontcards and traycards for CDs. It was
designed to simplify the process of generating labels for CD's. It
originated as a program to allow auto generation of frontcards and
traycards for CD's burned via an automated mechanism (specifically
for archiving data), but has now become popular for labelling CD
compilations of mp3's, and copies of CDs as well.
