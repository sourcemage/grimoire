Install this package only after you have created, and tested, a rescue disk
using the 'mkrescue' command.  Failure to do so could result in your system
becoming unbootable if something goes wrong during installation.  You have
been warned.

GNU GRUB is a Multiboot boot loader. It was derived from GRUB, GRand
Unified Bootloader, which was originally designed and implemented by Erich
Stefan Boleyn.  Spell originally submitted by ashaman@flyingtemple.com,
radically altered by jean@kcco.com to add autodetection of some partitions
and protections against accidentally making your system unbootable.
