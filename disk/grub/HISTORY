2002-03-26 Jean-Michel Smith <jean@kcco.com>
	* added all kinds of warnings to users to have a working rescue diskette
	  handy before attempting to install grub. If and when grub becomes a
	  standard part of the install I'll tone down the messages some.
	  moved cp of /usr/share/grub/i386-pc/*stage* from BUILD to POST_INSTALL
	* This corrects a serious bug during upgrades which causes stage1_5 and
	  stage2 files to get dispelled, making the system unbootable until the
	  next time grub is run and setup again.
	* POST_INSTALL: added some intelligence to to facilitate
	  easier installation and recovery from the above, corrected bug.
	* CONFIGURE: Added to facilitate configuration of some parameters.
	* Note that GRUB_ROOT is configured during POST_INSTALL, as the
	  autodetection scheme requires grub already be installed.

2002-03-25 Jean-Michel Smith <jean@kcco.com>
	* initial review and testing of grub spell for inclusion in grimoire
	* DETAILS: added LICENSE[0] information
	* fixed installation procedure to include copying needed files from
	  /usr/share/grub/i386-pc/*stage* to /boot/grub.
	* fixed installation procedure to put grub in /sbin, not /usr/sbin,
	  to insure it works on those systems that mount /usr separately
	* Work is still needed to make a sensible default menu.lst entry
	  based on the system's own hardware, in a POSTINSTALL script.
	  Work is still needed to make a sensible interface to lilo and grub
	  to allow installation and kernel spells to install/update grub
	  appropriately
	* HISTORY: Added

2002-03-24 Geoffrey Derber <gderber@sourcemage.org>
	* Initial submission of grub spell to SGL-Spell-Submit

	  this is.
