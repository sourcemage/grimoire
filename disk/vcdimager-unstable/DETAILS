GNU VCDImager is a full-featured mastering suite for authoring,
disassembling and analyzing Video CD's and Super Video CD's.

The core functionality consists of directly making Video CD BIN/CUE-style CD
images from mpeg files, which (after being written to CDR(W) media) can be
played on standalone VCD players or DVD players and on computers running
GNU/Linux, MacOS, Win32 or any other OS capable of accessing VCD's. BIN/CUE
images can be burned with cdrdao (please use a recent version, since older
ones do not support BIN/CUE-style cuesheets) under GNU/Linux (and other
supported platforms by cdrdao, e.g. freeBSD, Irix, Solaris and even win32)
