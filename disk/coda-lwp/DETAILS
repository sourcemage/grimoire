cat << EOF
Coda is a distributed filesystem with its origin in AFS2. It has many features
that are very desirable for network filesystems. Currently, Coda has several
features not found elsewhere.

  * disconnected operation for mobile computing
  * is freely available under a liberal license
  * high performance through client side persistent caching
  * server replication
  * security model for authentication, encryption and access control
  * continued operation during partial network failures in server network
  * network bandwith adaptation
  * good scalability
  * well defined semantics of sharing, even in the presence of network failures
