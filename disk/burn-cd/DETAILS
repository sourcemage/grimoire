Burn-CD is a handy frontend for the well-known cd/dvd writing packages
cdrtools & dvd+rw-tools. It's written in the Python programming language
and intended for use on any modern GNU/Linux OS.

Features:
 * simple and convenient -- just give it the files and dirs to burn;
 * supports CD&DVD -- use just one approach to burn any disk;
 * auto multisession -- no need to worry about your previous data;
 * text based -- could be used without graphics and remotely (ex. ssh, telnet);
 * lightweight -- start writing quickly straight where you are (ex. mc, xterm);
 * info mode -- evaluate the disk capabilities fast;
 * disk images -- it's possible to burn the premade disk images (ex. iso, mdf);
 * config file -- store your preferences in the config file (ex. verbose=yes);
 * cool progress bar =:)
