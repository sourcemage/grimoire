From website:
mtx is a set of low level driver programs to control features of SCSI backup 
related devices such as autoloaders, tape changers, media jukeboxes, and tape 
drives. It can also report much data, including serial numbers, maximum block 
sizes, and TapeAlert(tm) messages that most modern tape drives implement (to 
tell you the exact reason why a backup or restore failed), as well as do raw 
SCSI READ and WRITE commands to tape drives (not important on Linux, but 
important on Solaris due to the fact that the Solaris tape driver supports 
none of the additional features of tape drives invented after 1988). mtx is 
designed to be a low level driver in a larger scripted backup solution, such 
as Amanda. mtx is not supposed to itself be a high level interface to the SCSI 
devices that it controls.
