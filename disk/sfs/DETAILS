SFS is a secure, global network file system with completely decentralized control. SFS
lets you access your files from anywhere and share them with anyone, anywhere. Anyone
can set up an SFS server, and any user can access any server from any client. SFS lets
you share files across administrative realms without involving administrators or
certification authorities.
