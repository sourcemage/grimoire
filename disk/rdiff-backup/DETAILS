rdiff-backup backs up one directory to another, possibly over a network.
The target directory ends up a copy of the source directory, but extra reverse
diffs are stored in a special subdirectory of that target directory, so you
can still recover files lost some time ago. The idea is to combine the best
features of a mirror and an incremental backup.  rdiff-backup also preserves
subdirectories, hard links, dev files, permissions, uid/gid ownership,
modification times, extended attributes, acls, and resource forks. Also,
rdiff-backup can operate in a bandwidth efficient manner over a pipe, like
rsync. Thus you can use rdiff-backup and ssh to securely back a hard drive up
to a remote location, and only the differences will be transmitted. Finally,
rdiff-backup is easy to use and settings have sensical defaults.
