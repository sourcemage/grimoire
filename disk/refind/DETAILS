rEFInd is a fork of the rEFIt boot manager for computers based on (U)EFI.

rEFInd is a boot manager, meaning that it presents a menu of options to the
user when the computer first starts up, as shown below. rEFInd is not a boot
loader, which is a program that loads an OS kernel and hands off control
to it. Many popular boot managers, such as the Grand Unified Bootloader
(GRUB), are also boot loaders, which can blur the distinction in many users'
minds. All EFI-capable OSes include boot loaders, so this limitation isn't
a problem. If you're using Linux, you should be aware that several EFI boot
loaders are available, so choosing between them can be a challenge. In fact,
since version 3.3.0, the Linux kernel can function as an EFI boot loader
for itself, which gives rEFInd characteristics similar to a boot loader for
Linux.
