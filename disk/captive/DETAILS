Existing binary Microsoft Windows file system drivers were exploited for
accessing drives with possibly proprietary file system data structures.
Open file system API is provided to access these file system drivers.
Microsoft Windows system components required by these drivers were analyzed
and successfuly emulated in the GNU/Linux operating system.

The implementation allows applications running under the GNU/Linux operating
system to access NTFS drives. File system driver compatibility with VFAT,
ISO9660 and EXT2 is also provided.
