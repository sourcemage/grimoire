eMoviX is a package that allows you to create bootable CDs able to boot &
autoplay your multimedia files.  It is intended mainly to play video files but
if you want it can be used to play also audio files.  I plan to release
eventually a distro similar to eMoviX but aimed at audio only, so stay tuned!

The philosophy behind eMoviX is to make possible to generate video/audio CDs
that are self-sufficient, i.e. that you can play on every PC regardless of
what is installed on it: just insert the eMoviX CD inside a CD/DVD-ROM and
boot the PC from there!
