dvdisaster provides a margin of safety against data loss on CD and DVD media
caused by aging or scratches.
* dvdisaster creates error correction codes to compensate read errors which are
  not correctable in the CD/DVD drive.
* dvdisaster tries to read as much data as possible from defective media.
  Afterwards unreadable sectors are recovered using the previously created
  error correction code. The maximum error correction capacity is
  user-selectable.
If you create the error correction code file in time and keep it at a safe
place, you have a good chance of recovering the medium contents from typical
read errors and to transfer your complete data onto a new medium.
