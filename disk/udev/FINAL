MODALIAS and \$modalias are not needed and will be removed from one of
the next udev versions, replace it in all rules with ENV{MODALIAS} or
the sysfs "modalias" value.

RUN="/bin/program" not longer automatically adds the subsystem
as the first parameter. This is from the days of /sbin/hotplug
which is dead now and it's just confusing to need to add a space at
the end of the program name to prevent this.
If you use rules that need the subsystem as the first parameter,
like the old "udev_run_hotlugd" and "udev_run_devd", add the subsystem
to the key like RUN+="/bin/program $env{SUBSYSTEM}".
