cat << EOF
Cdrdao records audio/data CD-Rs in disk-at-once (DAO) mode based on a 
textual description of the CD contents (toc-file). Features include
full control over length and contents of pre-gaps (pause areas
between tracks). Pre-gaps may be completely omitted, e.g. for
dividing live recordings into tracks. Control over sub-channel data
like catalog numbers, copy, pre-emphasis, 2-/4-channel flags, ISRC
code, and index marks are provided as well. Cdrdao also has support
for exact audio CD copying. Tracks may be composed of different audio 
files supporting non-destructive cuts.
