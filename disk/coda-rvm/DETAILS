cat << EOF
RVM provides an unstructured recoverable virtual memory. The recoverable
storage is represented by Unix files or disk partitions that applications can
map at page granularity into the address space of a process. Simple, non-nested
atomic transactions guarantee permanence of changes to recoverable storage
across system crashes. Applications can schedule transaction logging actions
to enhance performance. The design stresses simplicity, ease of use, and high
performance. Unix compatibility is standard, while optional Mach-specific
extensions are supported for additional flexibility and performance. RVM has
been extensively used in the clients and servers of the Coda File System,
and in the Venari system.
