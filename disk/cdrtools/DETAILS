cdrtools, formerly Cdrecord creates home-burned CDs with a CD-R/CD-RW
recorder. It works as a burn engine for several applications. Cdrecord
supports CD recorders from many different vendors; all SCSI-3/mmc and
ATAPI/mmc compliant drives should also work. Supported features include
IDE/ATAPI, parallel-port, and SCSI drives, audio CDs, data CDs, and
mixed CDs, full multi-session support, CD-RWs (rewritable), TAO, DAO and
human-readable error messages. Cdrecord includes remote SCSI support and
can access local or remote CD-writers.

Giving the permission to burn a CD-R/CD-RW can be risky. Since CD-R/CD-RW
recorder is an IDE or SCSI device, it is possible to use cdrecord command 
with a hard disk, which would cause damage. So it is recommended to allow
only root or specific users to burn.
The spell will prompt you three choices to do this :
 [0] : Allow users from the burning group to burn (default)
 [1] : Only allow root to burn
 [2] : Allow users from the burning group to burn, with the suid-bit set.
	This way cdrecord process will have a higher priority as if it 
	run as root. This can be useful with some old CD-R/CD-RW recorders
	which don't have burnfree/buffer underrun protection. Cdrecord will
	be patched to pass through kernel security limitations.
If you choose [0] or [2], you will have then to add users in the burning 
group that the spell creates. Write permission for the burning group on the
CD-R/CD-RW recorder must be gived. This is done automatically by the spell 
scripts in differents ways, according do the device management system 
you use. Please NOTE that you have to do this manually with DEVFSD at this time.
