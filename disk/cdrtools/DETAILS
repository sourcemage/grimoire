Cdrtools is a set of command line programs that allows to record CD/DVD/BluRay
media.

The suite includes the following programs:

cdrecord     A CD/DVD/BD recording program
readcd       A program to read CD/DVD/BD media with CD-clone features
cdda2wav     The most evolved CD-audio extraction program with paranoia support
mkisofs      A program to create hybrid ISO9660/JOLIET/HFS filesystems with
optional Rock Ridge attributes
isodebug     A program to print mkisofs debug information from media
isodump      A program to dump ISO-9660 media
isoinfo      A program to analyse/verify ISO/9660/Joliet/Rock-Ridge Filesystems
isovfy       A program to verify the ISO-9660 structures
rscsi        A Remote SCSI enabling daemon

Giving the permission to burn a CD/DVD/BD can be risky. Since CD/DVD/BD
recorder is an IDE or SCSI device, it is possible to use cdrecord command
with a hard disk, which would cause damage.  So it is recommended to allow
only root or specific users to burn.

The spell will prompt you two choices to do this :

 [0] : Only allow root to burn
 [1] : Allow users from the burning group to burn, with the suid-bit set.
	  This way cdrecord process will have a higher priority as if it
	  run as root. This can be useful with some old CD-R/CD-RW recorders
	  which don't have burnfree/buffer underrun protection.

If you choose [1], you will have then to add users in the burning
group that the spell creates. Write permission for the burning group on the
CD/DVD/BD recorder must be gived. This is done automatically by the spell
scripts in differents ways, according do the device management system
you use. Please NOTE that you have to do this manually with DEVFSD at
this time.

If other users than root should be allowed to execute rscsi they need an
entry in /etc/default/rscsi.  If you do not change that entry, you should
create a user rscsi.
