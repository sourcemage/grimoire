From Website :
Sick of all those fancy CD-burning apps not working for you? You need something that just gets the work 
done? Welcome to BashBurn - It just works! 
 
BashBurn is the new name for the cd burning shell script Magma. It's not the best looking CD-burning 
application out there, but it does what you want it to do. (And if not then probably didn't want to do 
it anyway)
