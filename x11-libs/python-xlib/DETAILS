The Python X Library is intended to be a fully functional X client library for Python programs. It is written entirely in Python, in contrast to earlier X libraries for Python (the ancient X extension and the newer plxlib) which were interfaces to the C Xlib. 

This is possible to do since X client programs communicate with the X server via the X protocol. The communication takes place over TCP/IP, Unix sockets, DECnet or any other suitable streaming network protocol. The C Xlib is merely an interface to this protocol, providing functions suited for a C environment. 

There are three advantages of choosing to implement a pure Python library: 

*Integration: The library can make use of the wonderful object system in Python, providing an easy-to-use class hierarchy. 
* Portability: The library will be usable on (almost) any computer which have Python installed. A C interface could be problematic to port to non-Unix systems, such as MS Windows or OpenVMS. 
* Maintainability: It is much easier to develop and debug native Python modules than modules written in C.
