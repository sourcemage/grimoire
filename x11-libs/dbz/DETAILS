cat << EOF
A set of nearly a hundred truetype fonts created by Tom Murphy the seventh.
This set includes typefaces as diverse as Douglas Adams' handwriting
(based on a inscription written by the High Hitch-Hiker himself -
there's a frood who really knows where his towel is) and Cosine Katie
("Type one of the missing characters for a picture of Cosine Katie
herself, the only girl whose hair is a trigonometric function!"),
and including the entire tombats glyph sets.
