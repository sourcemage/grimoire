Inkscape is a vector based drawing program, like CorelDraw or Adobe 
Illustrator from the proprietary software world, and Sketch or 
KIllustrator from the free software world. 

Inkscape uses W3C SVG as native file format, being thus very useful tool 
for web designers. 

It has relatively modern display engine, giving you fine antialiased 
display, alpha transparencies, vector fonts and so on. Inkscape is 
a sodipodi fork.
