Inkscape is a vector based drawing program, like CorelDraw or Adobe Illustrator
from the proprietary software world, and Sketch or KIllustrator from the free
software world.

Inkscape uses W3C SVG as native file format, being thus very useful tool for web
designers.

It has relatively modern display engine, giving you fine antialiased display,
alpha transparencies, vector fonts and so on. Inkscape is a sodipodi fork.
