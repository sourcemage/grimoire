DuhDraw is a program which almost perfectly simulates TheDraw for DOS. 
Back in the good old BBSing days, TheDraw was a program used by a SysOp 
in order to draw ANSI screens, the only graphics available on BBSes for 
quite a while. However, for a long time, nobody considered Linux, as 
Linux BBSes were uncommon. Other applications of the software include 
login screens, and mud screens. I always thought it ironic that MUDs 
were mostly run off of Unix machines, and yet they used DOS editors to 
generate the ANSI screens.
