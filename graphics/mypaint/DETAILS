MyPaint is a fast and easy open-source graphics application for digital
painters. It lets you focus on the art instead of the program. You work on
your canvas with minimum distractions, bringing up the interface only when
you need it.

* Designed for pressure sensitive graphics tablets
* Simple and minimalistic user interface
* Extensive brush creation and configuration options
* Unlimited canvas (you never have to resize)
* Basic layer support

MyPaint comes with a large brush collection including charcoal and ink to
emulate real media, but the highly configurable brush engine allows you to
experiment with your own brushes and with not-quite-natural painting. Before
beginning it is a good idea to read the quick-start tutorial to see how the
program is meant to be used. You can also visit the MyPaint Wiki.

Related projects are DrawPile, Flowpaint, Qaquarelle, Gogh, Alchemy, Krita,
ChibiPaint, Harmony. You might like easystroke for defining gestures.
