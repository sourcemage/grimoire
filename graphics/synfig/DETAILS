synfig is a powerful, industrial-strength vector-based 2D animation software 
package, designed from the ground-up for producing feature-film quality 
animation with fewer people and resources. While there are many other programs
currently on the market to aid with the efficient production of 2D animation, 
we are currently unaware of any other software that can do what our software 
can.
