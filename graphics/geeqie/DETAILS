Geeqie has been forked from gqview project, because it was not possible to
contact gqview author and the only maintainer. Geeqie projects goal is to
move the development forward and also integrate the existing patches.

Geeqie implements a single-click interface to view images and traverse
the filesystem.  It can generate thumbnails, pipe images to external
editors, and display slideshows. (recommended by graphics guru)
