cat << EOF
jigl (pronounced jiggle) is a perl script that generates a static html photo 
gallery from one or more directories of gif/jpg/png images. It's fairly 
customizable and includes the ability to display comments and EXIF info for 
each image in a simple clean layout. 
 
jigl is written completely from scratch but the idea is heavily based on the 
program igal. 

HOWTO:
- Change to the directory with your images in it.
- run jigl.pl -cg This will create a gallery.dat file in the current directory.
- Edit the gallery.dat file with your favorite editor. Here you can change the 
  title, add some header or footer infomation to the index page, and add some 
  captions to your photos. 
- When you're done editing the file, save it and rerun jigl.pl
