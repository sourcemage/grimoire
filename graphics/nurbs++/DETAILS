           SHORT="C++ library to manipulate and create NURBS"
cat << EOF
Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) curves and surface are parametric functions which can represent any type of curves or surfaces. This C++ library hides the basic mathematics of NURBS. This allows the user to focus on the more challenging parts of their projects. The library also offers a lot of features to help generate NURBS from data points.

The NURBS++ package includes a matrix library, an image manipulation library, a numerical library and a NURBS library. They can all be used on their own but they are all developped to support my NURBS needs.

NURBS++ is being revived under sourceforge as the nurbs++ project (it is under the libnurbs directory for obvious reaons). Please use the sourceforge tools to send bug reports, feature requests, etc.
