 The GNU plotutils package contains software for both programmers and
 technical users. Its centerpiece is libplot, a powerful C/C++ function
 library for exporting 2-D vector graphics in many file formats, both vector
 and raster. It can also do vector graphics animations.

libplot is device-independent in the sense that its API (application
programming interface) does not depend on the type of graphics file to
be exported.

Besides libplot, the package contains command-line programs for plotting
scientific data. Many of them use libplot to export graphics.
