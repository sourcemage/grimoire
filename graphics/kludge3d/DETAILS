Kludge3d is a simple 3d polygonal modeler, based on code harvested from several other (presumably abandoned) projects. Kludge3d is released under the GPL, and requires GTK2 and gtkglext to work. 

Kludge3d, as the name implies, is a kludge. An ugly hack. It will never be the next 3d Studio MAX, or even the next Milkshape. I set out to fashion a usable GPL'ed level modeler, similar to AC3d, for creating game levels. Rather than re-invent the wheel, I based my efforts on several existing editors, and kludge3d is the result. I hope you will find it useful. 

What it does: 
  * loads and saves several file formats. 
  * creates vertices and polygons. No NURBS, splines, etc. 
  * organizes polygons into groups (aka meshes) 
  * applies textures to polygon meshes
