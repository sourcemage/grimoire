The Unidentified Flying Raw (UFRaw) is a utility to read and manipulate
raw images from digital cameras. It can be used on its own or as a Gimp
plug-in. It reads raw images using Dave Coffin's raw conversion utility
- DCRaw. UFRaw supports color management workflow based on Little CMS,
allowing the user to apply ICC color profiles. For Nikon users UFRaw has
the advantage that it can read the camera's tone curves. Even if you
don't own a Nikon, you can still apply a Nikon curve to your images.

The guiding concept in the development of UFRaw is to give all the
essential (and some non-essential) information and control over the
raw conversion, with the hope that one could resolve all the exposure
and white balance issues during the raw conversion. The obvious
advantage is that one can make full use of the raw data. The
provisional advantage is that this way we circumvent the current
8-bit limitation of the Gimp, as UFRaw does all manipulations in 16-bits.

There are some important features which are still missing in UFRaw:

 * 100% Zooming.
 * Sharpening.
 * Embed EXIF data - UFRaw can save the EXIF data to JPEG output for a
   few supported formats. These formats include Canon (CRW, CR2),
   Nikon (NEF), Pentax (PEF), Samsung (PEF), Sony (SR2, ARW), Fuji (RAF)
   and Adobe's DNG. For information on how to save EXIF data for other
   formats you should use ExifTool by Phil Harvey as is explained here.
