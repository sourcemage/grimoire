AdvanceCOMP is a collection of recompression utilities for your .ZIP archives,
.PNG snapshots, .MNG video clips and .GZ files.  It's mainly intended for
recompressing your rom, snapshot and clip collection of emulated games.

The main features are :
* Recompress ZIP, GZ, PNG and MNG files using the Deflate 7-Zip implementation.
* Recompress MNG files using Delta and Move optimization.

AdvanceCOMP includes four utilities, all of which allow the extend of DEFLATE
searching to be set of one of four levels:
* advpng, removal of ancillary chunks, concatenation of all individual IDAT
  chunks; then re-encoding of the combined PNG image file using the 7-Zip
  deflate method.
* advmng, attempt to make use of delta encoding, followed by re-encoding of
  compressed sections using 7-Zip deflate method.
* advdef, general re-encoding of anything featuring a zlib stream, this
  includes .gz and .png files.
* advzip, re-encoding of compressed DEFLATE streams within a .zip archive.
The additional searching performed during compression (and therefore additional
CPU usage), can often make gains of 5%-10% in compressed size, according to the
AdvanceCOMP authors. After using AdvanceCOMP, the output remains a backwards-
compatible and compliant DEFLATE stream, capable of being decoded by any
existing tools.
