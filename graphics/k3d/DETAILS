extensibility at runtime through third-party plugins; animated procedural
geometric effects; all parameters animatable through a consistent control-spline
based interface; rendering pipeline to Renderman Interface compliant rendering
engines; optimization for use with the BMRT rendering engine, which features
raytracing, radiosity rendering, true displacement, and user programmable
shaders; and support for background and batch rendering.
