PGF is a macro package for creating graphics. It is platform- and
format-independent and works together with the most important TeX backend
drivers, including pdftex and dvips. It comes with a user-friedly syntax
layer called TikZ.

Its usage is similar to pstricks and the standard picture environment. PGF
works with plain (pdf-)TeX, (pdf-)LaTeX, and ConTeXt. Unlike pstricks,
it can produce either PostScript or PDF output.
