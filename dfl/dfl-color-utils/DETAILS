           SHORT="implementation of the cylindrical color space model"
cat << EOF
A simple pure Qt/C++ implementation of the cylindrical color space model characterized by Hue-Chroma-Luma.
The HCL (or HCY) color space is better suited to calculate contrast ratios than the sRGB color space. The library
also contains some functions that are useful in creating colors with good contrast ratios.
