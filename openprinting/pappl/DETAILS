cat << EOF
PAPPL is a simple C-based framework/library for developing CUPS Printer Applications,
which are the recommended replacement for printer drivers.
It was specifically developed to support LPrint and a future Gutenprint Printer Application,
but is sufficiently general purpose to support any kind of printer or driver
that can be used on desktops, servers, and in embedded environments.
