cat << EOF
ODBC is the acronym for Open DataBase Connectivity, a Microsoft Universal
Data Access standard that started life as the Windows implementation of the
X/Open SQL Call Level Interface specification. Since its inception in 1992 it
has rapidly become the industry standard interface for developing database
independent applications. Is is also the emerging standard interface for
SQL based database engines replacing many of the first generation Embedded
SQL and proprietary call level interfaces provided by database engine and
database connectivity middleware vendors alike.
