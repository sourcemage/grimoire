Hiredis is a minimalist C client library for the Redis database.

It uses a high level printf-alike API in order to make it much higher level
than otherwise suggested by its minimal code base and the lack of explicit
bindings for every Redis command.

Apart from supporting sending commands and receiving replies, it comes with a
reply parser that is decoupled from the I/O layer. It is a stream parser
designed for easy reusability, which can for instance be used in higher level
language bindings for efficient reply parsing.

Hiredis only supports the binary-safe Redis protocol, so you can use it with
any Redis version >= 1.2.0.

The library comes with multiple APIs. There is the synchronous API, the
asynchronous API and the reply parsing API.
