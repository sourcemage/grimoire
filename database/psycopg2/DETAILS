Psycopg is a PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python programming language.
Its main advantages are that it supports the full Python DBAPI 2.0 and it is
thread safe at level 2. It was designed for heavily multi-threaded applications
that create and destroy lots of cursors and make a conspicuous number of
concurrent INSERTs or UPDATEs. The psycopg distribution includes ZPsycopgDA,
a Zope Database Adapter.
