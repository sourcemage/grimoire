cat << EOF
 With FBCopy, you can easily copy data between Firebird tables and 
databases. FBCopy is a command-line tool, so you can use it inside batch 
scripts, cron jobs, etc. Currently, Linux and Windows versions are 
available, but I hope it can be built with any compiler that can build IBPP 
library.
