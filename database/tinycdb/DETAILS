TinyCDB is a very fast and simple package for creating and reading constant
data bases, a data structure introduced by Dan J. Bernstein in his cdb package.

It may be used to speed up searches in a sequence of (key,value) pairs with
very big number of records. Example usage is indexing a big list of users -xi
where a search will require linear reading of a large /etc/passwd file, and for
many other tasks.

Its usage/API is similar to ones found in BerkeleyDB, gdbm and traditional *nix
dbm/ndbm libraries, and is compatible in great extent to cdb-0.75 package by
Dan Bernstein.
