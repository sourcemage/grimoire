Valkey is an open source (BSD) high-performance key/value datastore 
that supports a variety of workloads such as caching, message queues,
and can act as a primary database.
Valkey can run as either a standalone daemon or in a cluster,
with options for replication and high availability.

Valkey natively supports a rich collection of datatypes,
including strings, numbers, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets,
bitmaps, hyperloglogs and more.
You can operate on data structures in-place with an expressive collection of commands.
Valkey also supports native extensibility with built-in scripting support
for Lua and supports module plugins to create new commands, data types, and more.
