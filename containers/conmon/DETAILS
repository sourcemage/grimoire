cat << EOF
Conmon is a monitoring program and communication tool between a container
manager (like Podman or CRI-O) and an OCI runtime (like runc or crun) for a
single container. Upon being launched, conmon usually double-forks to daemonize
and detach from the parent that launched it. It then launches the runtime as
its child.

Written in C and designed to have a low memory footprint, conmon is intended
to be run by a container managing library. It provides socket attachment,
logging to file or systemd journal, and records the container's exit time and
code.
