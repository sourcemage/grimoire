Lilipod is a very simple container and image manager with minimal features.
It can download, unpack and use OCI images from various container registries.
Lilipod depends only on Linux utilities (nsenter, tar, cp, ps) which are
sourced from a bundled busybox static binary, ensuring working dependencies
even on atypical systems.

Lilipod aims to be extremely simple with few features, making it useful as
a fallback container manager for tools like Distrobox when Podman or Docker
are not available or cannot be installed.
