2011-05-15 Peng Chang (Charels) <chp@sourcemage.org>
	* DETAILS: updated to 3.8.4
	* PRE_BUILD: patch archinfo_x86.c; there's no reference builds for Corei2,
	  which will cause build failure and the detection for Corei2 is buggy, so
	  only Corei1 will be used
	* x86.patch: the patch for archinfo_x86.c
	* emit_mm.patch: not necessary any more

2011-05-14 Peng Chang (Charles) <chp@sourcemage.org>
	* BUILD, CONFIGURE, INSTALL: shared library is common practice and
	  required by nearly all dependents; so it is no longer an option,
	  and shared library is built nonetheless; and pt libraries will
	  never be used if they are named thus, so decide what kind of libraries
	  will be used at compilation time; I trust you can make the choice
	  if you really care how atlas performs
	* DETAILS: PATCHLEVEL++
	* PRE_BUILD: patching configure, removing duplicate object file from
	  liblapack.a
	* configure.patch: the patch

2011-05-13 Peng Chang (Charles) <chp@sourcemage.org>
	* DETAILS: PATCHLEVEL++
	* BUILD, CONFIGURE: clean up ineffective options
	* BUILD: fixed a bug unnoticed for 2 years, appending ${OPTS} to the end
	  of configure
	* PRE_BUILD: applying upstream patch to fix code generation problems
	  during build
	* emit_mm.patch: the above patch generated from upstream update

	* DEPENDS: added optional_depends lapack
	* DETAILS: version 3.8.3, this version has a new building and

	* INSTALL: changed accordingly
	* PRE_BUILD: added accordingly
	* README: attentions before building atlas
	* TRIGGERS: used to resolve conflicts with lapack
	* atlas-nog77.config, atlas-alpha.config: probably no longer
	  needed

2007-06-04 Thomas Orgis <sobukus@sourcemage.org>
	* BUILD, atlas-alpha.config: make it work on alphas,
	  prepare for better fortran handling for others, too
	* atlas-nog77.config: use symbol FORTRAN instead of
	  anonymous 0

2006-11-01 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
