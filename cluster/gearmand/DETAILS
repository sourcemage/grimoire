This is a rewrite (in C) of the Perl version found at
http://danga.com/gearman/. It includes the
both a client/worker library, as well as the server. The server acts as a
bridge between workers
(clients who can do work) and callers (clients who want work done). You
should run several servers
(at least two) for both load balancing and high availability.
