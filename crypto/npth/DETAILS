nPth - The New GNU Portable Threads Library

This is a library to provide the GNU Pth API and thus a
non-preemptive threads implementation.

In contrast to GNU Pth is is based on the system's standard threads
implementation.  This allows the use of libraries which are not
compatible to GNU Pth.  Experience with a Windows Pth emulation
showed that this is a solid way to provide a co-routine based
framework.
