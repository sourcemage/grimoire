scponly is an alternative "shell" of sorts for system administrators who
would like to provide access to remote users to both read and write local
files without providing any remote execution priviledges. Functionally, it
is a wrapper around the ssh suite of applications. It is typically used by
creating a user whose shell is set to scponly. This user can neither login
interactively nor execute commands remotely, but it can use scp and sftp
to download and upload files to the computer, governed by the usual Unix
file permissions.
