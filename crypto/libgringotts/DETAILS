libGringotts is a small, easy-to-use, thread-safe C library originally developed
for Gringotts. Its purpose is to encapsulate data in an encrypted and compressed
file. It uses strong cryptographic algorithms (RIJNDAEL 128/256, SERPENT, 
TWOFISH, CAST256, SAFER+, LOKI97, and 3DES for encryption, and SHA1 and 
RIPEMD-160 for hashing) to ensure the data are as safe as possible, and allow 
the user to have the complete control over all the encryption, hashing, and 
compression algorithms used in the process. It also provides functions for 
encrypting temporary files and to securely manage memory. It is based upon 
libmcrypt and mhash, and supports pkgconfig.
