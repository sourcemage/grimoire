cat << EOF
The wolfSSL embedded TLS library is a lightweight, portable, C-language-based
SSL/TLS library targeted at IoT, embedded, and RTOS environments primarily
because of its size, speed, and feature set. It works seamlessly in desktop,
enterprise, and cloud environments as well. wolfSSL supports industry standards
up to the current TLS 1.3 and DTLS 1.2, is up to 20 times smaller than OpenSSL,
offers a simple API, an OpenSSL compatibility layer, OCSP and CRL support,
is backed by the robust wolfCrypt cryptography library, and much more.
