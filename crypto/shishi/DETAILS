Shishi is a (still incomplete) implementation of the Kerberos 5 network authentication system. Shishi can be used to authenticate users in distributed systems. 

Shishi contains a library ('libshishi') that can be used by application developers to add support for Kerberos 5. Shishi contains a command line utility ('shishi') that is used by users to acquire and manage tickets (and more). The server side, a Key Distribution Center, is implemented by 'shishid'. Of course, a manual documenting usage aspects as well as the programming API is included.
