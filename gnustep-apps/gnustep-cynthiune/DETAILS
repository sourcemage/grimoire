cat << EOF
Cynthiune is a free software and romantic music player for GNUstep and MacOSX.

For the moment, it looks pretty much like XMMS, Winamp and similar software.
Even though it has far less features than those, the essential components of a
usable and user-friendly program are there in my opinion.
