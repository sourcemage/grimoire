Supported Hardware:
  i810-dc100, i810e, i815, i830M, 845G, 852GM/855GM, 865G, 915G,
  E7221 (i915), 915GM, 945G, 945GM, 945GME, 965G, G35, 965Q, 946GZ,
  965GM, 965GME/GLE, G33, Q35, Q33,
  Mobile Intel® GM45 Express Chipset,
  Intel Integrated Graphics Device, G45/G43, Q45/Q43, G41

Features:
* Full support for 8, 15, 16, and 24 bit pixel depths.
* Hardware accelerated 2D drawing engine support for 8, 15, 16 and 24 bit
  pixel depths.
* Hardware accelerated 3D drawing using OpenGL and the DRI.
* Hardware cursor support to reduce sprite flicker.
* Textured video XV implementation on i915 through i965.
* Hardware overlay XV implementation up through i945.
* Screen resize and rotation.

Technical Notes:
* Interlace modes cannot be supported.
* This driver  requires kernel support for AGP, which is included in Linux
  kernels 2.3.42 and higher, and FreeBSD 4.1 and higher.
* This driver may be built against xserver 1.2.0 or newer.  If built
  from git source against an older server, a copy of xserver 1.3.0 source is
  needed to complete the build, which is chosen with the --with-xserver-source
  argument to ./configure.  The compatibility mode with xserver 1.2.0 will have
  limited functionality, in particular by not supporting RandR 1.2 or the
  new Damage 1.1 updated needed for 3D applications to work with display
  rotation.

Known Limitations
* No support for "zaphod mode" dualhead.  This is the mode in which two
  Device sections are placed in the config file, and doesn't support DRI or
  many other features.  Instead, only "MergedFB-style" dualhead is supported.
* No support for X Screens larger than 2048 pixels in either direction
  before the 965.  This reflects hardware limitations in the x direction on
  those older chips, and limits dualhead functionality.  It may be possible to
  extend the limit vertically on these older chips.
* i855 XV may cause hangs.  This was present in the previous release, and no
  workaround is known.
* SDVO TV-out cards not supported.  This should be fixed in the next
  release.
* Gray output with integrated TV-out and PAL TVs.
* EXA support unstable on i845.
* Some GM965 systems, such as the Thinkpad T61, probe the TV as being connected
  even when no output connector is available.  This results in the gnome-panel
  issue noted below.
