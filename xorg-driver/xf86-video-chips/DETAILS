chips  is  an  Xorg driver for Chips and Technologies video processors.
The majority of the Chips and Technologies chipsets  are  supported  by
this  driver.  In  general  the  limitation on the capabilities of this
driver are determined by the chipset on which it is run.  Where  possi-
ble,  this driver provides full acceleration and supports the following
depths: 1, 4, 8, 15, 16, 24 and on the latest chipsets an 8+16  overlay
mode.  All  visual  types  are  supported for depth 1, 4 and 8 and both
TrueColor and DirectColor visuals are supported where possible.  Multi-
head configurations are supported on PCI or AGP buses.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
The  chips  driver  supports  video processors on most of the bus types
currently available.  The chipsets supported fall  into  one  of  three
architectural  classes.  A basic architecture, the WinGine architecture
and the newer HiQV architecture.

Basic Architecture

The supported chipsets are ct65520, ct65525, ct65530, ct65535, ct65540,
ct65545, ct65546 and ct65548

Color depths 1, 4 and 8 are supported on all chipsets, while depths 15,
16 and 24 are supported only on  the  65540,  65545,  65546  and  65548
chipsets.  The driver is accelerated when used with the 65545, 65546 or
65548 chipsets, however the DirectColor visual is not available.

Wingine Architecture

The supported chipsets are ct64200 and ct64300

Color depths 1, 4 and 8 are supported on both  chipsets,  while  depths
15,  16  and 24 are supported only on the 64300 chipsets. The driver is
accelerated when used with the 64300 chipsets, however the  DirectColor
visual is not available.

HiQV Architecture

The  supported chipsets are ct65550, ct65554, ct65555, ct68554, ct69000
and ct69030

Color depths 1, 4, 8,  15,  16,  24  and  8+16  are  supported  on  all
chipsets.   The  DirectColor  visual  is  supported on all color depths
except the 8+16 overlay mode. Full acceleration  is  supplied  for  all
chipsets.
