cat << EOF
leo is an Xorg driver for Sun Leo (ZX) video cards.

Also  known  as  the  ZX  or  T(urbo)ZX, Leo is a 24 bit accelerated 3D
graphics card. Both cards are double-width, but the TZX  also  requires
extra  cooling  in  the form of an additional double-width fan card, so
effectively takes up 4 SBus slots.

Workstations:

    Sun 4/15, 4/30, 4/75
