cat << EOF
mouse  is  an  Xorg  input  driver  for mice.  The driver supports most
available mouse types and interfaces.  USB mice are only  supported  on
some OSs, and the level of support for PS/2 mice depends on the OS.

The  mouse  driver functions as a pointer input device, and may be used
as the X server's core pointer.  Multiple mice are supported by  multi-
ple instances of this driver.
