           SHORT="mga  is  an  Xorg  driver  for Matrox video cards."
cat << EOF
mga  is  an  Xorg  driver  for Matrox video cards.  The driver is fully
accelerated, and provides support for the following framebuffer depths:
8,  15,  16,  24,  and an 8+24 overlay mode.  All visual types are sup-
ported for depth 8, and both TrueColor and DirectColor visuals are sup-
ported  for  the  other  depths except 8+24 mode which supports Pseudo-
Color, GrayScale and TrueColor.   Multi-card  configurations  are  sup-
ported.   XVideo  is  supported  on G200 and newer systems, with either
TexturedVideo or video overlay.  The second head of dual-head cards  is
supported  for  the G450 and G550.  Support for the second head on G400
cards requires a binary-only "mga_hal" module that  is  available  from
Matrox  <https://www.matrox.com>, and may be on the CD supplied with the
card.  That module also provides various other enhancements, and may be
necessary  to  use  the  DVI  (digital)  output  on the G550 (and other
cards).

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
The mga driver supports PCI and AGP video cards based on the  following
Matrox  chips.   They  are listed in approximate chronological order of
production (with the most recent chipsets listed last), so consult this
list when you are unsure whether your card is meant when references are
made to 'G200 and later' chips, for example.
