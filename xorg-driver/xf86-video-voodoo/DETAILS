cat << EOF
voodoo  is  an  XFree86  driver  for Voodoo 1 and Voodoo 2 series video
adapters.  On the Voodoo 1 the driver uses a shadow  buffer  in  system
memory as the video adapter has only 3D acceleration. Selected portions
of the shadow framebuffer are copied out to the  Voodoo  board  at  the
right  time. Because of this, the speed of the driver is very dependent
on the CPU. Processors nowadays are actually rather fast at moving data
so we get very good speed anyway as the shadow framebuffer is in cached
RAM.

The Voodoo2 has 16bpp acceleration and the driver provides  accelerated
versions  of most operations except angled lines and stipples. Acceler-
ated alpha blending with the Render extension is also supported  as  is
DGA.

This driver supports 16bpp modes currently. The video hardware supports
image conversion from 24bpp to 16bpp but the hardware is 16bpp only.

The Voodoo 1 series cards can go up to  800x600  resolution  while  the
Voodoo  2  can  reach  1024x768  providing it has at least 2Mb of frame
buffer memory. 1024x768 2D mode does not require two  cards  configured
in scan-line interleave mode (SLI).

Multihead and Xinerama configurations are supported. SLI configurations
will be treated as multiple video cards.

Limited support for DPMS screen saving is available. The "standby"  and
"suspend"  modes  are  just  painting  the screen black. The "off" mode
turns the Voodoo board off and thus works correctly.

This driver does not support a virtual screen size different  from  the
display  size.  This is a hardware limitation. 3D rendering is also not
supported.
