cat << EOF
vesa is an Xorg driver for generic VESA video cards.  It can drive most
VESA-compatible video cards, but only makes use of the  basic  standard
VESA core that is common to these cards.  The driver supports depths 8,
15 16 and 24.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
The vesa driver supports most VESA-compatible video cards.   There  are
some known exceptions, and those should be listed here.
