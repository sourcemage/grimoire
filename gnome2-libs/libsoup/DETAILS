cat << EOF
Soup is a SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) implementation for the
C programming language. It provides an queued asynchronous
callback-based mechanism for sending and servicing SOAP requests, and
a WSDL (Web Service Definition Language) to C compiler which generates
client stubs and server skeletons for easily calling and implementing
SOAP methods.
