gnome-print is a C-based API that implements the Postscript imaging model.
It is an actively developed project, and it is being used by various GNOME 
applications. There are two extensions to the Postscript imaging model supported
by gnome-print: Alpha channel support and anti-aliasing. gnome-print includes a
rasterizing engine that transforms the requests into bitmaps for native drivers.
