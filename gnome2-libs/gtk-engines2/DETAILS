gtk-engines provides a central location for commonly used GTK+ engines.

It currently supplies several engines and default themes for those which have
one.

1.) Crux - The engine created for the once popular theme by Eazel, Inc.
Unfortunately long without maintainence it is no longer as popular or
considered as useable as it once was.

2.) HC - The High Contrast engine is primarily targeted at Usability Themes,
such as the GNOME a11y themes HighContrast HighContrastLarge etc.

3.) Industrial - developed by Ximian, Inc. as the default apearance for its
Desktop. Industrial is a highly popular look which provides a simple,
consistant, and highly cohesive appearance for applications.

4.) LighthouseBlue - Developed by Jan Rosczak out of critques by Eugenia
Loli-Queru over the BlueCurve theme Copyright RedHat Inc. LightHouseBlue Engine
and theme experiments with certain concepts of usability such as Bold fonts on
current notebook tabs. etc.

5.) Metal - An engine and theme designed to mimic the Java Swing Metal apearance

6.) Mist - A minimalist engine designed to provide simple UI experiance.

7.) Redmond - An engine and theme designed to mimic the appearance of another OS

8.) Thinice - A once highly popular engine with thin edges and theme of Icy
Colors, providing a simple mostly clean apearance many find satisfying.

9.) Smooth - An engine currently gaining in popularity for its ability to
configure common theme elements with a high degree of flexibility, without
sacrificing too much in terms of speed or theme footprint size.
