libcanberra is an implementation of the XDG Sound Theme and Name
Specifications,
for generating event sounds on free desktops, such as GNOME. It comes with
several backends (ALSA, PulseAudio, OSS, GStreamer, null) and is designed to be
portable. It consists of the following parts:

   1. libcanberra: the main library
   2. libcanberra-gtk: some glue code to make it easier to use libcanberra from
      Gtk+ applications
   3. libcanberra-gtk-module: a Gtk+ module that uses libcanberra-gtk
   to trigger
      input feedback event sounds
