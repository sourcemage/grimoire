This package provides C++ bindings for GuiLoader.
GuiLoader is a high-performance and compact GuiXml loader library. This library
allows GTK+ applications to create GUI widgets and objects at run-time from
GuiXml resource files. GuiLoader is written in C language as a GObject
subclass and has a trivial language-independent API. GuiLoader was designed to
be easily wrapped for any language that has GTK+ bindings.
