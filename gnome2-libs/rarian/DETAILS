Rarian is designed to be a replacement for scrollkeeper.  It is
currently undergoing heavy development.  As of writing, rarian can be
installed in place of scrollkeeper and everything will work okay (as
far as my testing indicates)

The package consists of several things:

* The librarian library
  - This builds a list of available meta data files and allows access to these.

* The rarian-sk-update script
  - This is compatible with the scrollkeeper-update script that's required to
    be run when installing new omf files.  It converts the omf files into new-
    style scrolls

* The rarian-sk-migrate program
  - Takes in a directory full of omf's, reads and parses them and spews out
    an equivalent scroll file.  You probably don't want to use this directly.
    Instead, copy the omf directory to you're standard omf dir and run the
    update script.

* The rarian-example program
  - Shows off what librarian is capable of.  Prints a nice list of all
    available documents found by the library.

* Misc. rarian-sk-* scripts
  - These emulate various functions of scrollkeeper as needed to
    maintain backwards-compatibility.

This package (the library part, at least) is based on the proposed Freedesktop
Help System spec.  The latest version of this spec can be found in the "help"
subdirectory of this package.
