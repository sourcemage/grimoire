A major update to KDE/Plasma was released at the end of February.
KDE6 is now based on Qt6, whereas KDE5 was based on Qt5, which is deprecated and at end of life for non-commercial users.

This update has involved a massive  amount of work by many people.

In addition to adapting program code to changes in Qt itself, there as also been a significant amount of restructuring and code cleanup within KDE code.
KDE frameworks have been restructured and improved. Some frameworks have been removed, others merged, and some functions renamed or moved to 
different libraries. 

The various parts of KDE (frameworks, plasma, applications) amount to about 350 spells.

There are a few programs which have not yet been adapted to Qt6/KDE6, but the only major programs which do not yet have Kde6 compatible releases are Krita and Calligra.

There will probably be new releases of several programs in the next few weeks.

Most of the missing programs are likely to adapted by the time of the KDE 24.05 release in May.

Because of the major structural changes within KDE, I have made a new set of spells for KDE6.
These spells are in a separate repository smgl-kde6 and can be used in preference to the existing Qt5 based spells.

At the moment I have 310+ spells and have been using them on two systems for several months.

At some point these spells will replace those in the SMGL grimoire.
