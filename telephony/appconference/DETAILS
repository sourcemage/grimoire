App_conference is a channel-independent conference application.  It features
efficient audio mixing algorithms as well as video selection support based
on VAD, DTMF or CLI.


Design goals

Appconference has several design goals which are different than Meetme:

    * It does not require a zap channel for timing.
    * It is very efficient when used with channels which support DTX (silence
        detection/discontinuous transmission).

    * It can do VAD on channels which do not support DTX (although this
        is more expensive than just mixing them, but less expensive then
        encoding; therefore it might still be a win).
    * It presents messages on the Monitor interface for determine which
        speakers are active.

Mixing design

    * Minimize encoding/decoding, minimize mixing.
    * Minimize generational loss from trancoding.
    * Usual cases are handled very efficiently:
          o One speaker: That speaker's frame is sent directly to each
                participant which uses the same codec. It is trancoded _once_
                for each additional codec type used by participants.
          o Two speakers: Each speaker gets the other speaker's frames.
                The two speaker's frames are decoded and mixed, and then
                encoded _once_ for each codec type used by participants.

Video features

    * Video passthrough: video from selected member is passed to every
        member of the conference.
    * Multiple ways to select video
        - VAD - DTMF from conference members - CLI
    * Ability to set default video sources and to lock/unlock video sources.
