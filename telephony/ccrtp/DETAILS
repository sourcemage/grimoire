GNU ccRTP is an implementation of RTP, the real-time transport protocol from
the IETF (see
RFC 3550, RFC 3551 and RFC 3555). ccRTP is a C++ library based on GNU Common
C++ which
provides a high performance, flexible and extensible standards-compliant
RTP stack with full
RTCP support. The design and implementation of ccRTP make it suitable for
high capacity servers
and gateways as well as personal client applications.
