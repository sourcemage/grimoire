cat << EOF
UCommon is meant as a very light-weight C++ library to facilitate using C++
design patterns
even for very deeply embedded applications, such as for systems using uclibc
along with posix
threading support. For this reason, UCommon disables language features that
consume memory or
introduce runtime overhead, such as rtti and exception handling, and assumes
one will mostly be
linking applications with other pure C based libraries rather than using
the overhead of the
standard C++ library and other similar class frameworks.
