cat << EOF
There are numerous possible inter-client protocols, with many similarities and
common needs - authentication, version negotiation, byte order negotiation, and
so on. The Inter-Client Exchange (ICE) protocol is intended to provide a
framework for building such protocols, allowing them to make use of common
negotiation mechanisms and to be multiplexed over a single transport connection.
