cat << EOF
s6-linux-init is a set of minimalistic tools used to create a s6-based init
system, including a /sbin/init binary, on a Linux kernel. It is a part of
the s6 ecosystem.

The resulting architecture follows the Unix philosophy (one job -> one tool) as
closely as possible, and is fully dedicated to the s6 way of managing a system:


* s6-svscan runs as process 1 for the whole machine lifetime.
* Every daemon is supervised.
* No logs are ever lost.
* Policy is entirely left to the user. Typically, any service manager can be
  run on top of s6-linux-init.

Nevertheless, the architecture is fully compliant with various empirical
and historical specifications. For instance, it provides:


* utmp management compatible with sysvinit.
* runlevel management, with a configurable default, overridable from the kernel
  command line.
* sysvinit-like commands to shut the system down, including a shutdown command
  that follows the LSB specification.
