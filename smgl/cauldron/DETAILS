Cauldron is the suite of scripts for generating installation media (cauldron)
typically in the form of iso9660 filesystems to be burned onto cdroms, and the
scripts which run as the installation interface during the install
(enchantment). Both sets of scripts may be installed, or just one, as chosen
during the spell CONFIGURE stage.
