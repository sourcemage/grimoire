Quick reference for docing Source Mage project code (each lib/function):
========================================================================
@param: when order is important
@Arguments: when order is unimportant
@Stdout: what is dumped to stdout by this function
@Stderr: whe is dumped to stderr
@Stdin: what is expected from stdin
@return: what the return values mean
@Globals: global variables used

Some others are that are used:
@Type API: if it's an API function
@Synopsis
@Copyright
@License

Keep in mind that
<@function some_function> will make a link to the function in the docs.
The function is limited to being in the same file. 

Any funny symbols will not be translated for you, so putting <something>
in the comments would be a no-no.
