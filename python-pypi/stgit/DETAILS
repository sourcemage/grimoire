cat << EOF
StGIT is a Python application providing similar functionality to Quilt
(i.e. pushing/popping patches to/from a stack) on top of GIT. These operations
are performed using GIT commands and the patches are stored as GIT commit
objects, allowing easy merging of the StGIT patches into other repositories
using standard GIT functionality.

Note that StGIT is not an SCM interface on top of GIT and it expects a
previously initialised GIT repository. For standard SCM operations, either
use plain GIT commands or the Cogito tool.
