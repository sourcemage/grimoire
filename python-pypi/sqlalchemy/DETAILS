cat << EOF
SQLAlchemy is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives 
application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.
It provides a full suite of well known enterprise-level persistence patterns, 
designed for efficient and high-performing database access, adapted into a 
simple and Pythonic domain language.
SQLALCHEMY'S PHILOSOPHY
SQL databases behave less and less like object collections the more size and 
performance start to matter; object collections behave less and less like 
tables and rows the more abstraction starts to matter. SQLAlchemy aims to 
accommodate both of these principles.
SQLAlchemy doesn't view databases as just collections of tables; it sees them 
as relational algebra engines. Its object relational mapper enables classes to 
be mapped against the database in more than one way. SQL constructs don't just 
select from just tables?you can also select from joins, subqueries, and unions. 
Thus database relationships and domain object models can be cleanly decoupled 
from the beginning, allowing both sides to develop to their full potential.
