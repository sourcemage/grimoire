+        
+        PBR is a library that injects some useful and sensible default behaviors
+        into your setuptools run. It started off life as the chunks of code that
+        were copied between all of the `OpenStack`_ projects. Around the time that
+        OpenStack hit 18 different projects each with at least 3 active branches,
+        it seemed like a good time to make that code into a proper reusable library.
+        
+        PBR is only mildly configurable. The basic idea is that there's a decent
+        way to run things and if you do, you should reap the rewards, because then
+        it's simple and repeatable. If you want to do things differently, cool! But
+        you've already got the power of Python at your fingertips, so you don't
+        really need PBR.
+        
+        PBR builds on top of the work that `d2to1`_ started to provide for declarative
+        configuration. `d2to1`_ is itself an implementation of the ideas behind
+        `distutils2`_. Although `distutils2`_ is now abandoned in favor of work towards
+        `PEP 426`_ and Metadata 2.0, declarative config is still a great idea and
+        specifically important in trying to distribute setup code as a library
+        when that library itself will alter how the setup is processed. As Metadata
+        2.0 and other modern Python packaging PEPs come out, PBR aims to support
+        them as quickly as possible.
