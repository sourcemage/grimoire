cat << EOF
PyMe is a python interface to GPGME library.
PyMe's development model is GPGME + Python + SWIG (just like m2crypto is
an OpenSSL + Python + SWIG) combination which means that most of the functions
and types are converted from C into Python automatically by SWIG. In short, to
be able to use PyMe you need to be familiar with GPGME.
