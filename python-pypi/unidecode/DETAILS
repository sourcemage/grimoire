cat << EOF
It often happens that you have text data in Unicode, but you need to represent
it in ASCII. For example when integrating with legacy code that doesn't
support Unicode, or for ease of entry of non-Roman names on a US keyboard,
or when constructing ASCII machine identifiers from human-readable Unicode
strings that should still be somewhat intelligeble (a popular example of
this is when making an URL slug from an article title).

In most of these examples you could represent Unicode characters as "???" or
"\15BA\15A0\1610", to mention two extreme cases. But that's nearly useless
to someone who actually wants to read what the text says.

What Unidecode provides is a middle road: function unidecode() takes Unicode
data and tries to represent it in ASCII characters (i.e., the universally
    displayable characters between 0x00 and 0x7F), where the compromises taken
when mapping between two character sets are chosen to be near what a human
with a US keyboard would choose.

The quality of resulting ASCII representation varies. For languages of western
origin it should be between perfect and good. On the other hand transliteration
(i.e., conveying, in Roman letters, the pronunciation expressed by the text in
 some other writing system) of languages like Chinese, Japanese or Korean is a
very complex issue and this library does not even attempt to address it. It
draws the line at context-free character-by-character mapping. So a good
rule of thumb is that the further the script you are transliterating is from
Latin alphabet, the worse the transliteration will be.

Note that this module generally produces better results than simply stripping
accents from characters (which can be done in Python with built-in functions).
It is based on hand-tuned character mappings that for example also contain
ASCII approximations for symbols and non-Latin alphabets.
