This library is the reference implementation of the Python wheel packaging
standard, as defined in PEP 427.

It has two different roles:
    A setuptools extension for building wheels that provides the bdist_wheel
    setuptools command
    A command line tool for working with wheel files

It should be noted that wheel is not intended to be used as a library, and as
such there is no stable, public API.
