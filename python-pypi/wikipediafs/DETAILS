WikipediaFS is a mountable Linux virtual file system that allows to read
and edit articles from Wikipedia (or any Mediawiki-based site) as if they
were real files.

It is thus possible to view and edit articles using your favourite text-editor.
Text-editors tend to be more convenient than a simple browser form when it
comes to editing large texts and they generally include useful features such
as Mediawiki syntax highlighting and spell checking.

Advance usage of WikipediaFS includes easy development of scripts and bots.
Programs simply have to deal with normal files because this is WikipediaFS
which takes care of the HTTP layer. For example, it would be possible to use
WikipediaFS to perform a massive content migration from an existing site to
a Mediawiki.

Features: * Reading and editing articles, including subpages.  * User
configuration: add your own Mediawiki.  * Editing with your login.  * HTTPS,
HTTP authentication, proxy.
