A Python module for creating two-dimensional graphics in a manner that is
both cross-platform and cross-media; that is, it can support screen graphics
(e.g. QuickDraw, Windows, Tk) as well as file output (PostScript, PDF,
GIF, etc.). It makes use of the native 2D drawing calls of each backend,
for maximum efficiency and quality.
