This is an HP-sponsored project to develop Linux support for most
Hewlett-Packard OfficeJet, PSC, LaserJet, and PhotoSmart printer all-in-one
peripherals (also known as Multi-Function Peripherals or MFPs), which
depending on the model can print, scan, copy, fax, and/or access digital
camera memory cards.

It is a work in progress, but printing and scanning are supported on most
models, when either connected to the parallel port or USB on a Linux (Intel or
Alpha) workstation, or to a LAN with selected HP JetDirect print servers.
