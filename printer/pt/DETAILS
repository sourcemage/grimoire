PT is a configurable printing tool written in GTK+ for viewing and managing
print jobs of the Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS).
You can use PT to view, delete, hold, and release print jobs; even moving
jobs to another printer or changing their priority is supported.
Further administration tasks are not implemented since this program should
be easy-to-use, small, and running fast on older machines.
You can save space on your desktop for really important applications by
choosing which information about print jobs should be displayed.
