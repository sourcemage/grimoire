IJS is, first and foremost, a protocol for transmission of raster page
images.  This snapshot provides a reference implementation of the protocol,
the design of which is still in flux.  When the protocol specification is
published, it will be authoritative.  Applications should feel free to link
against the library provided in this package, adapt that code for their own
needs, or roll a completely new implementation.

The protocol is a fairly traditional client-server design.  In general, the
client sends one or more page images to the server, along with various
metadata.  Communication is through simple "commands", which are essentially
size-prefixed packets.  The client sends a command to the server, then waits
for a response command, either ACK or NAK.

This tarball provides an "IJS library" in the form of ijs, ijs_client, and
ijs_server.  It also provides an example client (capable of reading pnmraw
files) and an example server (capable of generating PostScript).
