a2ps is an Any to PostScript filter.  Of course it processes plain text files,
but also pretty prints quite a few popular languages (66).  Moreover it has
the ability to delegate the processing of some files to other filters (such as
groff, texi2dvi, dvips, gzip etc.), which allows a uniform treatment (n-up,
page selection etc.) of heterogeneous files.
