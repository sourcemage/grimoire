PLEASE NOTE:
HP are replacing hpijs with hplip for most of their printers. hplip also
supports their printer/scanner multifunction devices. You probably want to
cast hplip rather than hpijs, but you should check the list of the few devices
that still need hpijs at hpinkjet.sourceforge.net to be sure.

These are HP's open source printer drivers for their inkjet printers.  For
further information on getting your HP inkjet working under linux, see
http://www.linuxprinting.org.  If you find your ghostscript does not support
hpijs (test this be following the instructions at
http://hpinkjet.sourceforge.net), you may need to recompile ghostscript using
"cast -r -c ghostscript".
