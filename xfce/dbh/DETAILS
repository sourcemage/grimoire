A DBH is a convenient way to associate keys composed by characters to data
records. Any kind of digital information can go into the data record, such as
text, graphic information, database structures, you name it. The idea behind
using a DBH is to get rid of what is known as an index file in the database
world. In the DBH world, the index is built into the file format.
