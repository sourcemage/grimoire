This is a launcher with two states. Like a trigger.

You use it like this:
        First, create a script which accepts these arguments:
                - none
                        to check if on or off and output 0 or 1 (to stdout)

                - the value 1
                        to set the state to on

                - the value 0
                        to set the state to off

        If it can be used like this, its correct:
                $ blah/foo
                0
                $ blah/foo 1
                $ blah/foo
                1
                $ blah/foo 1
                $ blah/foo
                1
                $ blah/foo 0
                $ blah/foo
                0
                $ blah/foo 1
                $ blah/foo
                1

        Give this script to the launcher.

        Also two icons.

        And you are set ;)
