Denemo is a unique score editor which exports notation to LilyPond and 
ABC music formats. It also acts as a frontend for Csound score files. 
Denemo is different from most graphic music editors, this is partly because 
it was created to help edit Lilypond notation and partly because of its 
unique design philosophy.
Denemo tries to mimic the speed of notation entry in Lilypond as much as 
possible. Denemo sports a clean uncluttered interface with a very keyboard 
centric bent. This makes score creation with Denemo both quick and intuitive.
