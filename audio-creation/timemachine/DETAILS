I used to always keep a minidisc recorder in my studio running in a 
mode where when you pressed record it wrote the last 10 seconds of 
audio to the disk and then caught up to realtime and kept recroding. 
The recorder died and haven't been able to replace it, so this is a 
simple jack app to do the same job. It has the advantage that it 
never clips and can be wired to any part of the jack graph.

The idea is that I doodle away with whatever is kicking around in my 
studio and when I heard an interesting noise, I'd press record and 
capture it, without having to try and recreate it. :)
