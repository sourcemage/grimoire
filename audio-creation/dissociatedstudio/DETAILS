Dissociated Studio is an attempt to do something similar for audio to 
what Dissociated Press does for text. It takes a piece of audio (about 
4-5 minutes is practical on my 500 MHz PIII w/ 96MB of memory), segments 
it into (by default) 0.1 second segments, computes a matrix indicating 
how similar each segment is to each other segment, and then plays the 
piece through, occasionally skipping from one segment to another similar 
segment, while displaying various either informative or spiffy-looking 
(or both!) displays.
