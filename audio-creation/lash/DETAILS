LASH is a session management system for JACK and ALSA audio applications
on GNU/Linux. It is an implementation of a proposal that originated from
this  discussion. Its aim is to allow you to have many different audio
programs running at once, to save their setup, close them down and then
easily reload the setup at some other time. LASH doesn't deal with any
kind of audio data itself; it just runs programs, deals with
saving/loading (arbitrary) data and connects different kinds of virtual
audio ports together (currently JACK and ALSA sequencer ports). It can
also be used to move entire sessions between computers, or post sessions
on the Internet for download.
