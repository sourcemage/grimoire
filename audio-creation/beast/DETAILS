cat << EOF
BEAST (the Bedevilled Audio System) is a GTK+/GNOME based front-end to  
BSE (the Bedevilled Sound Engine). BSE is a shared library that comes   
with the necessary framework to simulate audio synthesis (modular 
synthesis) in realtime and allow for song composition. BEAST and BSE are 
provided under the terms of the GNU General Public License.

BEAST is currently in development stage, the BSE API has not fully 
stabelized yet. The rough goal of this project is to get an audio system 
that supports multiple song and sample formats (besides the newly 
introduced .bse format) as well as synthesis networks and allows full   
fledged editing and manipulation of them. Sample manipulation includes  
generation of new sounds from module networks, based on various forms of 
audio synthesis.
