Csound is an incredibly powerful and versatile software synthesis program. Drawing from a toolkit of over 450 signal processing modules, one can use
Csound to model virtually any commercial synthesizer or multi-effects processor. Csound literally transforms a personal computer into a high-end digital
audio workstation - an environment in which the worlds of sound-design, acoustic research, digital audio production and computer music composition all
join together in the ultimate expressive instrument. However, as with every musical instrument, true virtuosity is literally the product of both talent
and dedication. You will soon discover that Csound is the ultimate musical instrument. But you must practice! In return, it will reward your commitment
by producing some of the richest textures and uniquely beautiful timbres you have ever heard. In the audio world of Csound, knowledge and experience are
the key... and your imagination the only limitation.
