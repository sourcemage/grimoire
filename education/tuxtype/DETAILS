TuxTyping is an educational typing tutorial game starring Tux, the
Linux Penguin. The player guides Tux to eat fish which are falling
from the top of the screen. Each fish has a letter or a word written
on it. When the player presses the corresponding key, or types the
appropriate word, Tux will position himself to eat the fish. The game
is intended for children learning to type and to spell, though it
does have higher difficulty levels which even experienced typists may
find challenging.
