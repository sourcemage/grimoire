cat << EOF
Vis aims to be a modern, legacy free, simple yet efficient vim-like editor.

It extends vim's modal editing with built-in support for multiple
cursors/selections and combines it with sam's structural regular expression
based command language.

As an universal editor it has decent Unicode support (including double width and
combining characters) and should cope with arbitrary files including:

* large (up to a few Gigabytes) ones including:
  o Wikipedia/OpenStreetMap XML / SQL / CSV dumps
  o amalgamated source trees (e.g. SQLite)
* single line ones e.g. minified JavaScript
* binary ones e.g. ELF files
