Zim  brings the concept of a wiki to your desktop. Store information, link
pages and edit with WYSISYG markup. Creating a new page is as easy as linking
to a non-existing page. Pages are stored in a
folder structure, like in an outliner, and can have attachments.

This tool can be used to keep track of TODO lists or ideas, to take notes
during a meeting or to draft any other kind of text (blog entries, important
mails, etc.).

Zim handles several types of markup, like headings, bullet lists and of
course bold, italic and highlighted. This markup is saved as wiki text so
you can easily edit it with other editors. Because of the
autosave feature you can switch between pages and follow links while editing
without worries.
