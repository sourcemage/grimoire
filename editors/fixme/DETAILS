This package provides you with a way of inserting fixme notes in your
documents. Such notes can appear inline, as marginal notes, footnotes,
index entries, in the log file and as warnings on stdout. It is also
possible to summarize them in a list. When you switch from draft to
final mode, any remaining fixme note will be logged, but removed from
the document's body.
Additionally, critical notes will abort compilation with an informative
message. FiXme also comes with support for AUC-TeX.
