The nano project was started because of a few problems with the
wonderfully easy-to-use and friendly Pico text editor. GNU nano
features:

* Autoconf support.
* Truly free license (GNU GPL).
* Goto-line# command w/o flag.
* Case sensitive search function.
* Interactive search and replace.
* 2/3 - 1/8 size of Pico binary.
* Slang and ncurses support.
* Autoindent abillity.
* Displayed tab width option.
* Regular expression search and replace.
* Toggles for cmdline flags via Meta keys.
* Tab completion when reading/writing files.
The main disadvantage is lack of mailer integration, but this is also a
strength.  GNU nano aims to emulate Pico and perhaps provide extra
functionality.
