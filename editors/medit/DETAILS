cat << EOF
medit is a text editor started originally as a simple built-in editor component
in GGAP. The intention now is to make it a useful programming and
around-programming text editor.

Features:
 * Configurable syntax highlighting.
 * Configurable keyboard accelerators.
 * Multiplatform - works both on unix and windows.
 * Plugins: can be written in C or Python.
 * Configurable tools available from the main and context menus. They can be
   written in Python or Lua, or it can be a shell script.
 * Regular expression search/replace, grep and find frontends, builtin file
   selector, etc.
