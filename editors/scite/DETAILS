cat << EOF
As well as features found in standard text editing components, Scintilla
includes
features especially useful when editing and debugging source code. These
include
support for syntax styling, error indicators, code completion and call
tips. The
selection margin can contain markers like those used in debuggers to indicate
breakpoints and the current line. Styling choices are more open than with many
editors, allowing the use of proportional fonts, bold and italics, multiple
foreground and background colours and multiple fonts.
