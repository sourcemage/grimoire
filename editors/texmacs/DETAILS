GNU TeXmacs is a free WYSIWYG scientific text editor which was inspired
by both TeX and GNU Emacs. It is also possible to use TeXmacs as an
interface to computer algebra systems. The program implements
high-quality typesetting using TeX fonts, but it is also provides a
user-friendly interface. Finally, TeXmacs supports the Guile/Scheme
extension language, which makes it possible to adapt the user interface
to specific needs and even to extend the editor.
