      "Math" menus
    * 370 mathematical symbols can be inserted in just one click * wizards
    to generate code ('Quick document', 'Quick letter', tabular,
      tabbing and array environments)
    * LaTeX-related programs can be launched via the "Tools" menu * the
    standard Bibtex entry types can be inserted in the ".bib" file with
      the "Bibliography" menu
    * a "structure view" of the document for easier navigation of a document
    (by
      clicking on an item in the "Structure" frame, you can jump directly
      to the corresponding part of your document
    * extensive LaTeX documentation * in the "Messages / Log File" frame,
    you can see information about
      processes and the logfile after a LaTeX compilation
    * the "Next Latex Error" and "Previous Latex Error" commands let you reach
