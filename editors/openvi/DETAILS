OpenVi is an enhanced and portable implementation of the Berkeley vi / ex text
editor, originally developed by Bill Joy.

OpenVi is a fork of the vi / ex editor included with OpenBSD, which is derived
from version 1.79 of the nvi editor originally distributed as part of the
Fourth Berkeley Software Distribution (4BSD).

The nvi editor was developed by Keith Bostic of the Computer Systems Research
Group (CSRG) at the University of California, Berkeley, Sven Verdoolaege, and
other contributors. Nvi itself was derived from Steve Kirkendall's Elvis
editor.
