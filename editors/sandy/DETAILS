Sandy is an ncurses text editor with an easy-to-read, hackable C
source. Sandy tries to maximize screen estate, minimize the SLOC
used and not get in your way too much. It can somehow be controlled
using a named pipe that lives in /tmp and all preferences and
keybindings are to be chosen at compile time.
