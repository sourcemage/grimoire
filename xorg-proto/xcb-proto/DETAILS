cat << EOF
xcb-proto contains descriptions of the X Window System core protocol and
selected extensions in an XML-based data format.  They are used by the X
C Binding (XCB) library to generate much of its code, but you can also use
these descriptions for other purposes, such as decoding the X protocol or
building X Window System bindings for other languages.
