 Thunar uses external utilities - so called thumbnailers - to generate 
previews of certain files. Thunar ships with thumbnailers to generate 
previews of image and font files and can automatically use available 
GNOME thumbnailers if it was build with support for gconf.

However, even then, there are several file types for which no 
thumbnailer exists. The thunar-thumbnailers project provides additional 
thumbnailers for Thunar, that also cover less common file formats.
