Ksetiwatch is a monitoring tool for the Seti@home distributed computing
project, which searches for signals of extraterrestrial life. It displays the
state of the Seti@home client(s) running on your computer or in your local
network, and logs/manages completed work units and interesting signals. In
addition, Ksetiwatch features a skymap that displays all work units processed,
a graphical display of scientific data (gaussians, pulses, and triplets), a
dock icon with detailed status information about a client, the option to
start/stop the SETI@home clients, and much more.
