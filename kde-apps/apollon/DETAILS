Apollon is a peer-to-peer file-sharing program written for Linux.

Apollon uses the giFT core to connect to various networks, including OpenFT,
Gnutella, and FastTrack.

OpenFT is the homegrown giFT network, Gnutella is the network used by
BearShare, LimeWire and others and FastTrack is the popular network used by
KaZaA.

Apollon uses a plugin system which allows you to choose which network or
multiple networks you wish to use. Finally, plugins for the OpenNap and
SoulSeek networks are under development.
