With kArchiver, you can create tar.gz, tar.bz2, .zip... files just by dropping
them on this software! Of course, you can add files, remove, view one or more
files thanks to its multiselection window. You can also convert files between
.tar.gz and .tar.bz2. Wizards will help you to compile and installing software
throught an interface and to apply patches. Karchiver is now provided with an
archive "browser", that diplays archives in the current directory, a search tool
(find archives for easier access) A pretty tool is an automatic
splitter/unsplitter to make a file going into a floppy. kArchiver has been made
to be intuitive and powerful!
