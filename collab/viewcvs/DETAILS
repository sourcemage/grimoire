ViewCVS can browse directories, change logs, and specific revisions of files.
It can display diffs between versions and show selections of files based on
tags or branches. In addition, ViewCVS has "annotation" or "blame" support,
Bonsai-like query facilities (requires a database), template-based page
generation, and support for individually configuring virtual hosts. It also
includes support for CvsGraph -- a program to display the tree of revisions
and branches graphically.
