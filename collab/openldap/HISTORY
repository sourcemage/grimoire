2003-07-26 Sergey Lipnevich <sergey@sourcemage.org>
	* Removed one broken mirror planetmirror.com.
	  Revert init script changes, here's why. Log message or no log
	  message, the SLAPD_URL that was being used achieved its purpose:
	  make OpenLDAP listen on all available IP interfaces on two ports,
	  LDAP and LDAPS. Guessing the host name or listening on the
	  local interface only doesn't achieve this or makes things
	  too complicated.

2003-07-16 Eric Sandall <sandalle@sourcemage.org>
	* Now listens on localhost by default

2003-07-14 Eric Sandall <sandalle@sourcemage.org>

	* Upgrade to 2.1.17.
	  Sort out more dependency issues.

2003-03-31 Sergey Lipnevich <sergey@sourcemage.org>
	* Upgrade to 2.1.16.

2003-03-03 Sergey Lipnevich <sergey@sourcemage.org>
	* Upgrade to 2.1.14.
	  Cosmetic improvements to BUILD.
	  POST_INSTALL now uses "restart" instead of "start" and checks
	  configuration before restarting.
	  PRE_REMOVE has been removed. The rationale here is that we don't
	  need to stop the server if we remove old binaries and installing
	  new ones. Rather, we need to check config and restart the server
	  if the config files are fine. This gives us the benefit of the
	  old server still running if we have a configuration problem. The
	  admin can fix it and then restart the server. But if we stop the
	  server and then see a problem, it's too late because not only the
	  new server will not start, but the old one's binaries are gone.
	  The disadvantage here is that "dispel" operation doesn't stop the
	  server, which is OK, because in real world people don't remove
	  such vital things as directory randomly.
	  Correct spelling in slapd.sh.

2003-02-25 Eric Schabell <eschabell@sourcemage.org>
	* Cleaned out CONFIGURE and BUILD of installscript
	  calls.

2003-02-24 Eric Schabell <eschabell@sourcemage.org>
	* Updated to use librunlevel for init.d script.

2003-01-07 Sergey Lipnevich <sergey@sourcemage.org>
	* Upgraded to 2.1.12, the "stable release" from now on.
	  See http://www.openldap.org/software/download/.
	  For definition of the "stable", see http://www.openldap.org/faq/?file=225.

2003-01-04 Sergey Lipnevich <sergey@sourcemage.org>
	* Upgraded to 2.1.11.
	  Disabled Cyrus-SASL until better way to configure is available.
	  Update default configuration files.

2002-10-23 Sergey Lipnevich <sergey@sourcemage.org>
	* Upgraded to 2.1.8.
	  Fixed minor bug in CONFIGURE which introduced major consequences.

2002-10-16 Sergey Lipnevich <sergey@sourcemage.org>
	* SQL backend now compiles, thanks to suggestion by Eric Sandall (bug 1364).
	  Made generation of SQL backend implicit in unixODBC depends instruction.
	  Cleaned up CONFIGURE.

2002-10-14 Sergey Lipnevich <sergey@sourcemage.org>
	* Upgrade to 2.1.6 with checksum.

2002-08-09 Sergey Lipnevich <sergey@sourcemage.org>
	* Added dependency on Cyrus-SASL library for encrypted communication.
	  Added dependencies to allow for perl and shell backends to be compiled.
	  Perl dependency is commented out because of compilation problems,
	  supposedly due to perl 5.8.0.

2002-07-24 Sergey Lipnevich <sergey@sourcemage.org>
	* Scripts for generating default configuration have been changed to use new
	  structure: ou=<Users|Groups>,dc=<company>,dc=<TLD>. They will try to guess
	  the <company> and <TLD> parts from the host name.

2002-07-10 Sergey Lipnevich <sergey@sourcemage.org>
	* Updated to 2.1.x tree (2.1.2) and added extra CONFIGURE options.
	  Default backend will from now on be Berkeley DB (bdb). Main
	  advantage of this backend is that it is transactional.
	* Please note that there are compatibility issues between Lightweight
	  DB Manager (LDBM) backend in 2.0.x and 2.1.x. You can backup your
	  existing 2.0.x directory by exporting it entirely into LDIF format
	  using ldapsearch like this:
	* ldapsearch -D "<Root DN>" -W "(objectClass=*)" > wholedir.ldif
	* You will have to enter a Root DN's password. Then, when new version
	  of slapd is running, use ldapadd like this:
	* ldapadd -D "<Root DN>" -W -f wholedir.ldif -c -S skipped.ldif
	* Make sure slapd.conf has references to all schemas that are needed
	  for your objects. E.g., an object will be skipped (and added to the
	  skipped.ldif if you use the command above), if classes it belongs
	  to or attributes it has, are not described by any schema.

2002-05-08 Sergey Lipnevich <sergey@sourcemage.org>
	* Corrected default ldap.conf to have only one pam_password attribute,
	  with value "exop", which is best for OpenLDAP.

2002-04-28 Sergey Lipnevich <sergey@sourcemage.org>
	* Added code creating valid slapd.conf and ldap.conf, using files provided by
	  Eric Sandall <sandalle@sourcemage.org> as a guide.
	  Added to slapd.conf "misc.schema" which contains some useful attributes.

2002-04-16 Sergey Lipnevich <sergey@sourcemage.org>
	* Added slapd.sh, services, and BUILD files. slapd.sh for init, services for
	  reference (slapd doesn't need these entries), BUILD just uses
	  default_build and then installs slapd.sh along the lines of the same
	  process in net/bind spell. Also added PRE_REMOVE and POST_INSTALL to take
	  care of running instance of slapd when casting/dispelling.
