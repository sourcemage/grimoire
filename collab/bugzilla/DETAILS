cat << EOF
Bugzilla is one example of a class of programs called "Defect Tracking
Systems", or, more commonly, "Bug-Tracking Systems". Defect Tracking Systems
allow individual or groups of developers to keep track of outstanding bugs in
their product effectively.
Bugzilla has matured immensely, and now boasts many advanced features. These
include:
* integrated, product-based granular security schema
* inter-bug dependencies and dependency graphing
* advanced reporting capabilities
* a robust, stable RDBMS back-end
* extensive configurability
* a very well-understood and well-thought-out natural bug resolution protocol
* email, XML, console, and HTTP APIs
* available integration with automated software configuration management
  systems, including Perforce and CVS (through the Bugzilla email interface
  and checkin/checkout scripts)
* too many more features to list
