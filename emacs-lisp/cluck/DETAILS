cat << EOF
A shameless clone of Quack 0.37.  Neil Van Dyke deserves all of the
credit for the overall look-and-feel, in particular the spiffy
PLT-style fontification and especially the pretty lambda.

Changes:

  * removed configuration for multiple schemes
  * removed documentation for other schemes
  * swapped out keyword syntax tables for R5RS + Chicken 4
  * added support for chicken-doc lookups
  * added support for localized manual URLs
  * reorganized the menus

The result is much better suited to Chicken scheming and probably worthless
for any other flavor.
