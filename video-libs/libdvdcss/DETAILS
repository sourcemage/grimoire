libdvdcss is a cross-platform library for transparent DVD device
access with on the fly CSS decryption. It currently runs under Linux,
FreeBSD, BSD/OS, Solaris, BeOS, Win98 and Win2k. It is used for the
vlc DVD player because of its portability and because, unlike similar
libraries, it does not require your DVD drive to be region-locked.
