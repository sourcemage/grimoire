Open Source API and interchange format for editorial timeline information,

OTIO contains information about the order and length of cuts and references to external media. It is 
not however, a container format for media.

For integration with applications, the core OTIO library is implemented in C++ and provides an 
in-memory data model, as well as library functions for interpreting, manipulating, and serializing 
that data model. Within the core is a dependency-less library for dealing strictly with time, 
`opentime`.
