Plugins for gstreamer.
A set of plug-ins that aren't up to par compared to the rest.  They might be
close to being good quality, but they're missing something - be it a good code
review, some documentation, a set of tests, a real live maintainer, or some
actual wide use.  If the blanks are filled in they might be upgraded to become
part of either gst-plugins-good or gst-plugins-ugly, depending on the other
factors.
