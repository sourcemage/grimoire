This code forms a set of C++ libraries for multimedia streaming, using open
standard protocols (RTP/RTCP, RTSP, SIP). These libraries - which can be
compiled for Unix (including Linux and Mac OS X), Windows, and QNX (and other
POSIX-compliant systems) - can be used to build streaming applications. The
libraries are already being used to implement applications such as "liveCaster"
and "playRTPMPEG" (for streaming MP3 audio using RTP/RTCP). The libraries can
also be used to stream, receive, and process MPEG or H.263+ video, and several
audio codecs. They can easily be extended to support additional (audio and/or
video) codecs, and can also be used to build basic RTSP or SIP clients and
servers, and have been used to add streaming support to existing media player
applications, such as "MPlayer".
