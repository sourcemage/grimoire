What Frei0r is
Frei0r is a minimalistic plugin API for video effects.
The main emphasis is on simplicity for an API that will round up the most
common
video effects into simple filters, sources and mixers that can be controlled by
parameters. It's our hope that this way these simple effects can be shared
between many applications, avoiding their reimplementation by different
projects.
What Frei0r is not
Frei0r is not meant as a competing standard to more ambitious efforts that try
to satisfy the needs of many different applications and more complex effects.
It is not meant as a generic API for all kinds of video applications, as it
doesn't provides things like an extensive parameter mechanism or event
handling.
Eventually the frei0r API can be wrapped by higher level APIs expanding its
functionalities (for instance as GStreamer, MLT, FFmpeg and others do).
