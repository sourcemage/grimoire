cat << EOF
Heaptrack traces all memory allocations and annotates these events with stack traces.
Dedicated analysis tools then allow you to interpret the heap memory profile to:

- find hotspots that need to be optimized to reduce the **memory footprint** of your application
- find **memory leaks**, i.e. locations that allocate memory which is never deallocated
- find **allocation hotspots**, i.e. code locations that trigger a lot of memory allocation calls
- find **temporary allocations**, which are allocations that are directly followed by their deallocation
