cat << EOF
* generates HTML, SGML, XML, SQL, Postscript, form email, LaTeX, or any
  other text-based format.
* cleanly separates content, graphic design, and program code. This
  leads to highly modular, flexible, and reusable site architectures; faster
  development time; and HTML and program code that is easier to understand 
  and maintain. It is particularly well suited for team efforts.
* blends the power and flexibility of Python with a simple template
  language that non-programmers can understand.
* gives template writers full access to any Python data structure,
  module, function, object, or method in their templates.
* makes code reuse easy by providing an object-orientated interface to
  templates that is accessible from Python code or other Cheetah templates.
  One template can subclass another and selectively reimplement sections of it.
* provides a simple, yet powerful, caching mechanism that can
  dramatically improve the performance of a dynamic website.
* compiles templates into optimized, yet readable, Python code.
