cat << EOF
Pygtk MVC is a multiplatform implementation of a dialect of the
Model-View-Controller and Observer patterns for the PyGTK2 toolkit.

MVC is a pattern that can be successfully used to design and develop well
structured GUI applications. The MVC pattern basically helps in separating
sematics and data of the application, from their representation.

Within Pygtk MVC the Observer pattern is also embedded. This pattern allows
making separated parts independent, but still connected each other.

The main focus of this implementation is the usability at first. Sometimes
it happens that the usage of design patterns like MVC makes the software
architecture too convoluted, since the pattern itself becomes the gravity
centre of the software that is being designed.

Pygtk MVC is a framework designed with the goal of being minimal, and thought
to have the lowest impact on the design of the application. This puts the
attention mostly on the application that must be developed, instead of on
the framework that stays behind the scene.

The MVC pattern has been adapted to better click with the way PyGTK-based
applications are designed. In particular the Model and the View entities do
not see and know each other, and the controller is responsible for controlling
both of them. To reduce dangerous connections between the Controller and
the Model, the Observer pattern is provided as well.

The framework makes it easy and natural to design and implement middle and
large applications based on PyGTK from scratch. This is not always the case
of already existing applications, when the effort of adapting them might
very significant.
