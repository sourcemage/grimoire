cat << EOF
PyProtocols extends the PEP 246 adapt() function with a new "declaration API"
that lets you easily define your own protocols and adapters, and declare what
adapters should be used to adapt what types, objects, or protocols. In
addition to its own Interface type, PyProtocols can also use Twisted and
Zope's Interface types too. (Of course, since Twisted and Zope interfaces
aren't as flexible, only a subset of the PyProtocols API works with them.
Specific limitations are listed in the documentation.)
