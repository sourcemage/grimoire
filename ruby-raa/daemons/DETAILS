cat << EOF
Daemons provides an easy way to wrap existing ruby scripts (for example a
self-written server) to be run as a daemon and to be controlled by simple
start/stop/restart commands.   If you want, you can also use daemons to
run blocks of ruby code in a daemon process and to control these processes
from the main application.   Besides this basic functionality, daemons
offers many advanced features like exception backtracing and logging (in
case your ruby script crashes) and monitoring and automatic restarting of
your processes if they crash.   Daemons includes the daemonize.rb script
written by Travis Whitton to do the daemonization process.
