cat << EOF
Kismet is an 802.11 wireless network sniffer - this is different from a
normal network sniffer (such as Ethereal or tcpdump) because it separates
and identifies different wireless networks in the area. Kismet works with
any 802.11b wireless card which is capable of reporting raw packets (rfmon
support), which include any prism2 based card (Linksys, D-Link, Rangelan,
etc), Cisco Aironet cards, and Orinoco based cards. Kismet also supports
the WSP100 802.11b remote sensor by Network Chemistry and is able to monitor
802.11a networks with cards which use the ar5k chipset.
