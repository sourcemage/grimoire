cat << EOF
This client for pbbuttonsd displays small popup windows each time a message from the daemon pbbuttonsd appeares. The view of each popup could individually configured. The following windows could pop up:

  * brightness level
    The current display brightness level would be displayed.
  * keyboard illumination level
    The current keyboard brightness level would be displayed.
  * volume level
    The current volume level would be displayed
  * mute
    The window shows if the speakers were muted.
  * battery warning
    This window shows that battery is running low and how long it would last until shutdown.
  * trackpad mode
    This window shows the current trackpad mode.
  * sleep warning
    This window shows that the machine is going to enter sleep mode. Usually at that time you could press any key or move the mouse to prevent sleep mode.
  * ejecting CDROM
    This window signals that a CDROM will be ejected or the tray will be closed.
  * activate external video
    This window shows the status of the external video output as soon as the status has been changed by pbbuttonsd. 

The window appears after someone has pressed one of the special keys or an event message has been received. After roundabout two seconds without any changes, the popup window vanishes again.

The client gives the user a visual feedback of the daemons background work and displays those events to the user that the daemon believes the user should know about. It won't run without a running daemon.
