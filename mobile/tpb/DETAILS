cat << EOF
With TPB it is possible to bind a program to the ThinkPad, Mail, Home and
Search button.
TPB can also run a callback program on each state change with the changed state
and the new state as options. So it is possible to trigger several actions
on different events.
TPB has a on-screen display (OSD) to show volume, mute, brightness and some
other informations.
Furthermore TPB supports a software mixer, as the R series ThinkPads have no
hardware mixer to change the volume.
