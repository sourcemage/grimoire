wm2 is a window manager for X. Using wm2, you can:
           move windows around the screen;
           resize windows both horizontally and vertically;
           hide windows;
           restore hidden windows; and
           delete windows.

wm2 also adds a stylish frame to each managed window.

wm2 does not provide:
           icons;
           configurability;
           a virtual desktop;
           extendable root menus;
           toolbars - button panels - docking areas - &c.

wm2 is therefore the ideal window manager for today's elegant and ascetic programmer.
