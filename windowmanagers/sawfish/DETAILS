cat << EOF
Sawfish is an extensible window manager using a Lisp-based scripting
language --all window decorations are configurable and all user-interface
policy is controlled through the extension language. This is no layer on
top of twm, but a wholly new architecture.
Despite this extensibility its policy is very minimal compared to most
window managers. Its aim is simply to manage windows in the most flexible
and attractive manner possible. As such it does not implement desktop
backgrounds, applications docks, or other things that may be achieved
through separate applications.
