JWM is a window manager for the X11 Window System. JWM is written in C and uses
only Xlib at a minimum. The following libraries can also be used if available:

    * libXext for the shape extension
    * libXext for the render extension
    * libXinerama for Xinerama support
    * libXpm for XPM backgrounds and icons
    * libjpeg for JPEG backgrounds and icons.
    * libpng for PNG backgrounds and icons
    * libxft for antialiased and true type fonts
    * libfribidi for right-to-left language support

It can support some MWM, GNOME, and WM Spec hints.
