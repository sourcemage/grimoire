Labwc stands for Lab Wayland Compositor, where lab can mean any of the following:

  * sense of experimentation and treading new ground
  * inspired by BunsenLabs and ArchLabs
  * your favorite pet

Labwc is a wlroots-based window-stacking compositor for wayland, inspired by openbox.

It is light-weight and independent with a focus on simply stacking windows well
and rendering some window decorations. It takes a no-bling/frills approach and
says no to features such as icons (except window buttons), animations,
decorative gradients and any other options not required to reasonably
render common themes. It relies on clients for panels, screenshots, wallpapers
and so on to create a full desktop environment.

Labwc tries to stay in keeping with wlroots and sway in terms of general approach and coding style.

Labwc has no reliance on any particular Desktop Environment, Desktop Shell or session.
Nor does it depend on any UI toolkits such as Qt or GTK.
