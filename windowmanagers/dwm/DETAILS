In contrast to ion, larswm, and wm
s much smaller, faster and simpler.
* dwm is only a single binary, it's source code is intended to never
exceed 2000 SLOC.
* dwm is based on tagging and dynamic window management (however
simpler than ion, wmi or larswm). It manages windows in tiling and
floating modes. Either mode can be applied dynamically, depending on
the application in use and the task performed.
* dwm doesn't distinguishes between layers, there is no floating or
tiled layer. Wether the clients of currently selected tag(s) are
in tiled mode or not, you can re-arrange all clients on the fly.
Popup- and fixed-size windows are treated floating, however.
* dwm is customized through editing its source code, that makes it
extremely fast and secure - it does not process any input data
which hasn't been known at compile time, except window title names
and status text read from standard input. You don't have to learn
Lua/sh/ruby or some weird configuration file format (like X
resource files), beside C to customize it for your needs, you only
have to learn C (at least editing header files).
* Because dwm is customized through editing its source code, it's
pointless to make binary packages of it. This keeps its userbase
small and elitist. No novices asking stupid questions.
* dwm uses 1-pixel borders to provide the maximum of screen real
estate to clients. Small titlebars are only drawn in front of
unfocused clients.
* dwm reads from standard input to print arbitrary status text (like
the date, load, battery charge). That's much simpler than
larsremote, wmii and what not...
* It can be downloaded and distributed under the conditions of the
MIT/X Consortium license.
* Optionally you can install dmenu to extend dwm with a wmii-alike 
menu.
