cat << EOF
TinyWM is a ridiculously tiny window manager implemented in nearly as few lines
of C as possible, without being obfuscated or entirely useless. It allows you
to move, resize, focus (sloppy), and raise windows -- that's it!  TinyWM's main
purpose is to serve as a quick example of some window manager programming
basics.
