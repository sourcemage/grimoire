cat << EOF
Oroborus basically is a really minimalistic window manager, which is about 75kb
small on a PowerPC machine and about 63kb on an x86 machine.
"Minimalistic" means that the Oroborus window manager doesn't provide some
things other window managers provide. So you will need some external tools also
provided by this project.
