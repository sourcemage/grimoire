cat << EOF
Kahakai is a fork of the Waimea window manager (www.waimea.org), with
the goal of allowing as much internal customization as possible.
Kahakai uses SWIG (www.swig.org) to provide wrappers that allow high-
level scripting languages to access the internals of the core of the
window manager, which is written in C++.
