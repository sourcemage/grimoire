NOTE: this wm exists only as a tarball on http://frankhale.org.
There doesn't seem to be a project website anymore and the last update was on 2005-05-29
so I consider this project dead. However, it still builds...

This window manager picks up where aewm leaves off and tries to do things that
the author of aewm wishes not to do. If you like virtual desktops, want an icon
menu or interoperability with fspanel then aewm++ is what you should be using.
