Sway is an incredible window manager, and certainly one of the most well
established wayland window managers. However, it is restricted to only
include the functionality that existed in i3. This fork ditches the simple
wlr_renderer, and replaces it with our fx_renderer, capable of rendering with
fancy GLES2 effects. This, along with a couple of minor changes, expands
sway's featureset to include the following:

  * Blur
  * Anti-aliased rounded corners, borders, and titlebars
  * Shadows
  * Dim unfocused windows
  * Per application saturation control: Allows the user to set the saturation
    (Digital Vibrance) for specific applications. Great for some FPS games!
  * Scratchpad treated as minimize: Allows docks, or panels with a taskbar, to
    correctly interpret minimize / unminimize requests
