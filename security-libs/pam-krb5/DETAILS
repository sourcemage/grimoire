cat << EOF
pam-krb5 provides a Kerberos v5 PAM module that supports authentication, user ticket cache handling, simple authorization (via .k5login or checking Kerberos principals against local usernames), and password changing. It can be configured through either options in the PAM configuration itself or through entries in the system krb5.conf file, and it tries to work around PAM implementation flaws in commonly-used PAM-enabled applications such as OpenSSH and xdm.

This is not the Kerberos v5 PAM module maintained on Sourceforge and used on Red Hat systems. It is an independent implementation that, if it ever shared any common code, diverged long ago. It supports some features that the Sourceforge module does not (particularly around authorization), and does not support some options (particularly ones not directly related to Kerberos v5) that it does. This module will never support Kerberos v4 and will probably never directly support AFS (AFS is probably better-supported via a dedicated AFS PAM module that can be stacked with the Kerberos module of your choice). The main reason why I use and maintain this module rather than the Sourceforge module is the search_k5login feature, but I also believe the source code is cleaner and easier to understand and maintain.

This module is based on the Kerberos PAM module by Frank Cusack, which in turn was based on ideas taken from PAM modules written by Naomaru Itoi, Curtis King, and Derrick Brashear. It incorporates improvements made to the Debian version of the module by Sam Hartman and other fixes by Joel Kociolek. The 1.1 and 1.2 releases were done by Andres Salomon. I took over maintenance of this module as of 2.0 in order to incorporate many additional fixes and improvements I was doing for Debian and to provide a regular upstream distribution that could be used for the Heimdal module in Debian and that we could use at Stanford for Red Hat and Solaris.
