MiniSat is a minimalistic, open-source SAT solver, developed to help
researchers and developers alike to get started on SAT.

Some key features of MiniSat:

* Easy to modify. MiniSat is small and well-documented, and possibly also
  well-designed, making it an ideal starting point for adapting SAT based
  techniques to domain specific problems.
* Highly efficient. Winning all the industrial categories of the SAT 2005
  competition, MiniSat is a good starting point both for future research in
  SAT, and for applications using SAT.
* Designed for integration. MiniSat supports incremental SAT and has
  mechanisms for adding non-clausal constraints. By virtue of being easy to
  modify, it is a good choice for integrating as a backend to another tool,
  such as a model checker or a more generic constraint solver.
