cat << EOF
Gmm++ is a generic C++ template library for sparse, dense and skyline
matrices. It is built
as a set of generic algorithms (mult, add, copy, sub-matrices, dense and
sparse solvers ...)
for any interfaced vector type or matrix type. It can be view as a glue
library allowing
cooperation between several vector and matrix types. However, basic sparse,
dense and
skyline matrix/vector types are built in Gmm++, hence it can be used as a
standalone linear
algebra library. Interfacing a vector or matrix type means writing "traits"
objects called
"linalg_traits", which describe their properties. The library offers
predefined dense,
sparse and skyline matrix types.
