The Point Cloud Library (or PCL) is a large scale, open project for point
cloud processing. The PCL framework contains numerous state-of-the art
algorithms including filtering, feature estimation, surface reconstruction,
registration, model fitting and segmentation. These algorithms can be used,
for example, to filter outliers from noisy data, stitch 3D point clouds
together, segment relevant parts of a scene, extract keypoints and compute
descriptors to recognize objects in the world based on their geometric
appearance, and create surfaces from point clouds and visualize them -- to
name a few.
