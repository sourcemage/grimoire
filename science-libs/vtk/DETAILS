The Visualization ToolKit (VTK) is an open source, freely available software
system for
3D computer graphics, image processing, and visualization. VTK consists of
a C++ class library,
and several interpreted interface layers including Tcl/Tk, Java, and
Python. VTK supports a wide
variety of visualization algorithms including scalar, vector, tensor, texture,
and volumetric
methods, and advanced modeling techniques such as implicit modelling,
polygon reduction, mesh
smoothing, cutting, contouring, and Delaunay triangulation. In addition,
dozens of imaging
algorithms have been directly integrated to allow the user to mix 2D imaging /
3D graphics
algorithms and data. The design and implementation of the library has been
strongly influenced
by object-oriented principles.
