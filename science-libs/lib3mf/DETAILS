lib3mf is a C++ implementation of the 3D Manufacturing Format file standard.

It provides 3MF reading and writing capabilities, as well as conversion and
validation tools for input and output data. lib3mf runs on Windows, Linux
and MacOS and offers a clean and easy-to-use API in various programming
languages to speed up the development and keep integration costs at a minimum.

As 3MF shall become an universal 3D Printing standard, its quick adoption
is very important. This library shall lower all barriers of adoption to any
possible user, let it be software providers, hardware providers, service
providers or middleware tools.
