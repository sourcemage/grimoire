The Qt WebChannel module offers Qt release-service a seamless way to publish QObjects
for interaction with HTML/JavaScript clients. These clients can either be inside
local Qt WebView\`s or any other, potentially remote, client which supports 
JavaScript, as long as a communication channel such as WebSocket is available.
