cat << EOF
This is a graphical front-end for the excelent programs 'mkisofs' and
'cdrecord'.
It can also burn mp3 to cd audio.
It's good for:
	Avoiding coasters due to command-line mistakes
	Eliminating the tedium of consulting documentation
	Feeling more secure in a correct set of options
	Being lazy

cdrtoaster is written in the tk scripting language, and thus is extremely 
small, yet very functional.
