playerctl is a command-line utility and library for controlling media players
that implement the MPRIS D-Bus Interface Specification. playerctl makes it
easy to bind player actions, such as play and pause, to media keys. You can
also get metadata about the playing track such as the artist and title for
integration into statusline generators or other command-line tools.

For more advanced users, Playerctl provides an introspectable library
available in your favorite scripting language that allows more detailed
control like the ability to subscribe to media player events or get metadata
such as artist and title for the playing track.
