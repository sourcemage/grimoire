           SHORT=OJ Mixer is a mixer program for linux capable of fading between presets.
cat << EOF
OJ Mixer is a mixer program for Linux, intended for users who wish to save volume level presets, and switch between them. It was developed for the staff of Freenode Radio (http://radio.freenode.net/), so that we don't have to run through level checks, fine-tuning everything before each show. However, it is generic enough for others to use as well. 


The program consists of a small window with buttons for every preset, a "Fade on switch" checkbox, and a "Show mixer settings" disclosure widget. Clicking the "Show mixer settings" brings the mixer board and a set of buttons for working with the presets. They should be pretty much self-explanatory.
