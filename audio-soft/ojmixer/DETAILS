OJ Mixer is a mixer program for Linux, intended for users who wish to 
save volume level presets, and switch between them. It was developed 
for the staff of Freenode Radio (http://radio.freenode.net/), so that 
we don't have to run through level checks, fine-tuning everything before 
each show. However, it is generic enough for others to use as well. 

The program consists of a small window with buttons for every preset, 
a "Fade on switch" checkbox, and a "Show mixer settings" disclosure widget. 
Clicking the "Show mixer settings" brings the mixer board and a set of buttons 
for working with the presets. They should be pretty much self-explanatory.
