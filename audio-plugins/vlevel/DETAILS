VLevel keeps your music from making you jump out of your seat, and it keeps
you from having to fiddle with the volume constantly. It's different from
other dynamic compressors because it looks ahead. You can think of VLevel
as someone who knows your music by heart, and turns the volume up during
quiet passages, but smoothly turns it back down when he knows a loud part
is coming. It's great for making CDs to listen to in your car, or to play
background music on your computer.

VLevel is currently a LADSPA plugin and a command-line filter. You can use
it with many Linux audio programs including XMMS, GStreamer, GLAME, GDAM,
and others, and you can use it in shell scripts to level your music before
burning a CD. In the future, it may be ported to other audio programs like
SOX and WinAMP, and it will be made generally easier to use.
