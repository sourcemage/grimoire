Olivier Lapicque, author of ModPlug, which is arguably the best quality
MOD-playing software available, has placed his sound rendering code in
the public domain.  This library and plugin is based on that code.

NOTE TO FELLOW OPEN SOURCE PROGRAMMERS (from the README):
 "I (Kenton Varda) no longer have the time or desire to maintain this
  library. If anyone would like to take over for me, please e-mail me at
  <temporal@gauge3d.org>. Thanks."
