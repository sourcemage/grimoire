OddcastV2 - XMMS is made up of two separate programs. The first is an XMMS effect plugin does the very simple task of taking the audio data from XMMS and sending it to the second program which is a standalone program called (aptly enough) "oddcastv2". "oddcastv2" is the wxWindow UI standalone program which is responsible for taking the raw audio data (fed to it via the effect plugin) and converting it to the appropriate compressed audio codec (MP3 and Vorbis supported) and then sending it out to the appropriate streaming server (Shoutcast, Icecast1.x, Icecast2 supported). "oddcastv2" will also perform things like resampling (going from 44kHz to 22kHz or to 32kHz) as well as channel down/upmixing (converting from Mono to Stereo and vice-versa).

The XMMS effect plugin sends the data to "oddcastv2" via a defined named pipe. The Effect plugin has only one configuration option and that is for the name of this named pipe. "oddcastv2" has a *ton* of options, and is, in general, kinda difficult to configure, but not overly-so (hopefully).
