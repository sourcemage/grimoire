Dracut builds a bootable initramfs. The initramfs responsible for mounting
the root filesystem and starting the main init system.

Many Linux distributions ship a single, generic kernel image that is intended
to boot as wide a variety of hardware as possible. The device drivers for
this generic kernel image are included as loadable modules, as it is not
possible to statically compile them all into the one kernel without making it
too large to boot from computers with limited memory or from lower-capacity
media like floppy disks.

This then raises the problem of detecting and loading the modules necessary
to mount the root file system at boot time (or, for that matter, deducing
where or what the root file system is).

To further complicate matters, the root file system may be on a software RAID
volume, LVM, NFS (on diskless workstations), or on an encrypted partition. All
of these require special preparations to mount.

Another complication is kernel support for hibernation, which suspends
the computer to disk by dumping an image of the entire system to a swap
partition or a regular file, then powering off. On next boot, this image
has to be made accessible before it can be loaded back into memory.

To avoid having to hardcode handling for so many special cases into the kernel,
an initial boot stage with a temporary root file system -now dubbed early
user space- is used. This root file system would contain user-space helpers
that would do the hardware detection, module loading and device discovery
necessary to get the real root file system mounted.
