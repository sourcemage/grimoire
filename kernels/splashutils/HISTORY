	* CONFIGURE: That's TrueType Fonts, not TIFF images...
	* DEPENDS: Depends on klibc (statically links to it) and libmng
	* PRE_BUILD: Added build setup (symlink to /usr/src/linux-<version>,
	  install-rootify config.h, etc.)
	* BUILD: Removed build setup (symlink to /usr/src/linux-<version>,

	* DETAILS,CONFIGURE,BUILD,INSTALL,FINAL: Created
	  Tarball includes freetype-2.1.9, jpeg-6b, klibc-1.0.8, libpng-1.2.8,
	  and zlib-1.2.1 for linking. :(
	  Didn't see David's version here until after I wrote this one.
	  Main difference between the two is mine doesn't deal with themes
	  (similar to how bootsplash doesn't and has boot-theme to do that,
	  except that I haven't written splash-theme yet ;)).
