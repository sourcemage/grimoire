QEMU achieves a good emulation speed by using dynamic translation.
QEMU has two operating modes:

* Full system emulation. In this mode, QEMU emulates a full system (for example
  a PC), including a processor and various peripherials. It can be used to
  launch different Operating Systems without rebooting the PC or to debug system
  code.
* User mode emulation (Linux host only). In this mode, QEMU can launch Linux
  processes compiled for one CPU on another CPU.

KQEMU is the kernel accelerator module for qemu.
Substantially improves performance.

Emulator     : Typical Slowdown Ratio
QEMU         : between 5 and 10
QEMU + Accel : between 1 and 2
