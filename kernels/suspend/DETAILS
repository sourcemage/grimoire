The goal of the project is to create a tool that can handle the so called
"suspend-to-both". Suspend to both means that prior putting the system in STR
(suspend to ram) a snapshot of the running system is taken and stored on disk
(as suspend to disk); if for any reason (e.g. battery depleted) the state store
in the RAM is lost the user can resume from the disk without loosing data. 
 
Currenty suspend-to-ram and suspend-to-disk are handled by two different
program, s2ram and suspend.

s2ram is a small program designed designed to suspend your machine to RAM and
bring it back to life.

Suspend to RAM can be as simple as doing:
  # echo mem > /sys/power/state
but many systems require additional steps (such as POSTing the video board,
saving/restoring card state, asking the BIOS to initialize the video card, etc.)

s2ram contains its own database with known machines and required workarounds,
so most of the times it will "just work".

suspend is the reference implementation of the userspace software suspend
(Âµswsusp); it coordinates the steps necessary to suspend the system (such as
freezing the processes, preparing the swap space, etc.) and handles image
writing and reading. suspend alreay supports compression and encryption of the
image and other features (e.g. a nice progress bar, saving the image on a
remote disk, playing tetris while resuming, etc.) can be easily added.

Currently requires the 2.6.16 -mm tree (or 2.6.17 when it is out).
