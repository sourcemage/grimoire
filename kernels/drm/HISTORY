	* FINAL: do the depmod against the kernel version in question

2007-07-14 Andraž "ruskie" Levstik <ruskie@mages.ath.cx>
	* INSTALL: temporary fixup to install the novuea_drm.h
	  until a new libdrm is out that has it

2007-05-30 Eric Sandall <sandalle@sourcemage.org>
	* BUILD: Build against the target kernel

2007-03-31 David Brown <dmlb2000@gmail.com>
	* POST_INSTALL: moved to final depmod -a changes files that are already
	  volatiles anyway

	* CONFIGURE: added nouveau
	* INSTALL: sure there is... it's always good to be verbos in installs
	  I hate installs that don't output anything... I always wonder if
	  something broke at that point.

	* PRE_INSTALL: Remove backup of kernel modules
	* INSTALL: No need to be verbose when calling mkdir
	  Use get_kernel_version rather than uname
