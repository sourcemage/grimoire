Rhapsody is an IRC client for Unix operating systems intended to be 
displayed on a text console or terminal. It is small, fast, portable 
and easy to use, yet it is full featured. The thing that separates it 
from the crowd is its intuitive menu driven user interface. Check out 
the screenshot area for more information.

It is written entirely from scratch in C and uses the ncurses 
library. It compiles and has been tested on Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, 
NetBSD, Solaris, IRIX, Mac OS X, BeOS and Cygwin.
