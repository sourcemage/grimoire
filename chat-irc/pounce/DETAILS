pounce is a multi-client, TLS-only IRC bouncer. It maintains a persistent
connection to an IRC server, acting as a proxy and buffer for a number
of clients. When a client connects, any messages received since it last
disconnected will be relayed to it. Unlike some other bouncers, pounce uses
a single buffer for all IRC messages, which acts as a queue from which each
client reads messages independently.

pounce speaks regular modern IRC to both servers and clients, using the
server-time extension to indicate when messages originally occurred. Clients
identify themselves to pounce by their IRC usernames.
