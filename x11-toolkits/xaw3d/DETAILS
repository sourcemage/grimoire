This is Release 1.5 of a set of 3-D widgets based 
on the R6.1/R6.3/R6.4 Athena Widget set.  The Three-D Athena may be 
used as a general replacement for the Athena (Xaw) Widget set.

In general, you may relink almost any Athena Widget based application 
with the Three-D Athena Widget set and obtain a three dimensional 
appearance on some of the widgets. On systems with shared libraries, 
you can usually replace your shared libXaw with libXaw3d and obtain 
the three dimensional appearance without even relinking.

Top and bottom shadow colors, shadow width, top and bottom shadow 
contrast should be self explanatory, and may be set via the usual 
and customary methods, e.g. app-defaults, .Xdefaults, programmatically, 
with editres, etc.  The user data resource may be used to "hang" 
application specific data on a widget, and is only settable 
programmatically.
