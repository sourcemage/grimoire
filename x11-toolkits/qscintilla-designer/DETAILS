cat << EOF
This is QScintilla plugin for Qt Designer. It provides widgets for editors
created with Qt.
QScintilla is a port to Qt of Neil Hodgson's Scintilla C++ editor class.
 As well as features found in standard text editing components, QScintilla
 includes features
especially useful when editing and debugging source code. These include
support for syntax
styling, error indicators, code completion and call tips. The selection
margin can contain
markers like those used in debuggers to indicate breakpoints and the current
line. Styling
choices are more open than with many editors, allowing the use of proportional
fonts, bold
and italics, multiple foreground and background colours and multiple fonts.
