Musique is a music player designed by and for people that love music. Musique
does its best to stay out of the way and keep you focused on the only thing
that really matters: Music. You need to try it to really get it.

On first run, just point Musique to your music folder and let it scan. This
will take some time depending on the size of your library, but it's a
one-time operation.

To set expectations right â€” Musique is not about podcasts or internet radio;
it's not about managing mobile devices and it has no integrated music store.
It's about listening to beautiful music.
