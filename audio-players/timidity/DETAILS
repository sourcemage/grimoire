TiMidity++ is a software synthesizer. It can play MIDI files by converting
them into PCM waveform data; give it a MIDI data along with digital instrument
data files, then it synthesizes them in real-time, and plays. It can not
only play sounds, but also can save the generated waveforms into hard disks
as various audio file formats.
