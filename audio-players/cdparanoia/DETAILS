Cdparanoia is a Compact Disc Digital Audio (CDDA) extraction tool, commonly
known on the net as a 'ripper'.  Cdparanoia will read correct, rock-solid audio
data from inexpensive drives prone to misalignment, frame jitter and loss of
streaming during atomic reads. Cdparanoia will also read and repair data from
CDs that have been damaged in some way.
