From the audacious FAQ: Why did you fork beep-media-player?

First off, the fork has no political reasons, it is based entirely on
technical merit. It's based on a few issues:

    * BMP classic had a number of deficiencies relating to Unicode.  
    * BMP classic is no longer actively maintained by the development team.
    * We had our own ideas about how a player should be designed, which we
      wanted to try in a production environment.  
    * Beep lacked functionality that is useful for people who do streaming, 
      such as the songchange plugin from XMMS.

Therefore, a fork seemed most logical as a choice for accomplishing
our goals. The BMP team has done very good work, but their ideas for a
next-generation beep do not align with ours.
