	* INSTALL, BUILD: added missing files for the last commit

	* BUILD: use qt4_build
	* moved the spell to audio-players since spells in
	  kde4-apps get installed in /opt/kde4 (this spell is
	  not a kde 4 application)

2009-06-28 Florian Franzmann <siflfran@hawo.stw.uni-erlangen.de>
	* INSTALL, BUILD: added. Install executable to /usr/bin instead
	  of /opt/kde4/...
	  The spell doesn't even depend on kde and non-kde-users won't
	  want it to install anything to /opt/kde4
