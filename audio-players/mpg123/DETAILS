mpg123 is a real time MPEG1.0/2.0/2.5 Audio Player for Layer 1,2 and Layer3.
It is small/fast and comes with a nice control interface for frontends
as well as simple terminal control.
You can play streams from http (shoutcast, too) and it supports gapless mp3
playback and relative volume adjustment (normalize RVA2 tags, ReplayGain
values).

Since version 1.0.0 this package contains libmpg123, the mpg123 decoder as
library to be directly used by other programs, too.

Since version 1.23.0, there is also libout123, the output modules of
mpg123 as library to be re-used.
