DerMixD takes an arbitrary number of input channels and creates an arbitrary
number of mixes on an arbitrary number of output channels (i.e. audio device
on host machine).
It is controlled via simple commands on a local or TCP socket (you can talk
to it with telnet) that are scriptable in a timed manner.
Most important input classes are MPEG audio files/streams via (recent)
mpg123 and libsndfile (there is a sine generator for fun and raw audio input
and on the output side there's OSS and ALSA as well as raw and text
(tab-separated value).
