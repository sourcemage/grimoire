cat << EOF
The Latin Modern family of fonts consists of 72 text fonts and 20 mathematics
fonts, and is based on the Computer Modern fonts released into public domain
by AMS (copyright Â© 1997 AMS). The lm font set contains a lot of additional
characters, mainly accented ones, but not exclusively. There is one set of
fonts, available both in Adobe Type 1 format (*.pfb) and in OpenType format
(*.otf). There are five sets of TeX Font Metric files, corresponding to: Cork
encoding (cork-*.tfm); QX encoding (qx-*.tfm); TeX'n'ANSI aka LY1 encoding
(texnansi-*.tfm); T5 (Vietnamese) encoding (t5-*.tfm); and Text Companion
for EC fonts aka TS1 (ts1-*.tfm).
