This toolkit primarily provides modules for performing both
traditional and object-oriented i/o on things *other* than
normal filehandles; in particular, IO::Scalar,
IO::ScalarArray, and IO::Lines.

In the more-traditional IO::Handle front, we have
IO::AtomicFile which may be used to painlessly create files
which are updated atomically.

And in the "this-may-prove-useful" corner, we have
IO::Wrap, whose exported wraphandle() function will clothe
anything that's not a blessed object in an IO::Handle-like
wrapper... so you can just use OO syntax and stop worrying
about whether your function's caller handed you a string, a
globref, or a FileHandle.
