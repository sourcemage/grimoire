           SHORT="Wakeonlan is a Perl script that sends 'magic packets' to wake-on-LAN enabled ethernet adapters and motherboards, in order to switch on remote computers."
cat << EOF
WOL is based on the following principle:

When the PC shuts down, the NIC still gets power, and keeps listening on
the network for a 'magic' packet to arrive. This packet must contain a
certain byte-sequence, but can be encapsulated in any kind of packet (IPX,
IP, anything). Take a look at the code for the magic sequence.

This program uses UDP for sending the packet. The complete UDP packet,
sent over an ethernet interface, looks something like this:

[ethernet header][IP header][UDP header][Magic sequence][CRCS]

The only goal of the script is to send this packet over the network. It expects
no returning data, since the NIC only listens, and does not reply anything.
