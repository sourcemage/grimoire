This module lets you ask the user for a password in the traditional way,
from the keyboard, without echoing.

This is not intended for use over the web; user authentication over the web
is another matter entirely. Also, this module should generally be used in
conjunction with Perl's crypt() function, sold separately.

The read_password function prompts for input, reads a line of text from the
keyboard, then returns that line to the caller. The line of text doesn't
include the newline character, so there's no need to use chomp.
