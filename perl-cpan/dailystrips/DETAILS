This Perl script downloads the URL for the current comic of various 
strips that are available online, and outputs these URLs to an HTML 
file. This enables you to view all of your favorite strips at once, 
instead of visiting several different websites.

One feature that sets this program apart from the rest is the ability 
to operate in 'local' mode. This mode, instead of writing the addresses 
to images in the HTML file, actually downloads the image and saves it 
locally. This way, you do not have to wait for each image to download - 
it's already on your hard drive. This is most useful when dailystrips 
is run from a cron script.
