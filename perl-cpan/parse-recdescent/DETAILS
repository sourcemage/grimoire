cat << EOF
RecDescent incrementally generates top-down recursive-descent text
    parsers from simple yacc-like grammar specifications. It provides:

        * Regular expressions or literal strings as terminals (tokens),

        * Multiple (non-contiguous) productions for any rule,

        * Repeated, optional and alternate subrules within productions,

        * Late-bound (run-time dispatched) subrules

        * Full access to Perl within actions specified as part of the grammar,

        * Simple automated error reporting during parser generation and parsing,

        * The ability to commit to, uncommit to, or reject particular
          productions during a parse,

        * Incremental extension of the parsing grammar (even during a parse),

        * Precompilation of parser objects,

        * User-definable reduce-reduce conflict resolution via
          "scoring" of matching productions.

    See the file "RecDescent.pod" for excruciating detail on all of this.
