Term::ProgressBar provides a simple progress bar on the terminal, to
let the user know that something is happening, roughly how much stuff
has been done, and maybe an estimate at how long remains.

A typical use sets up the progress bar with a number of items to do,
and then calls update to update the bar whenever an item is processed.

Often, this would involve updating the progress bar many times with
no user-visible change. To avoid uneccessary work, the update method
returns a value, being the update value at which the user will next see
a change. By only calling update when the current value exceeds the next
update value, the call overhead is reduced.

Remember to call the $progress->update($max_value) when the job is done
to get a nice 100% done bar.
