cat << EOF
Params::Util provides a basic set of importable functions that makes checking
parameters a hell of a lot easier.

While they can be (and are) used in other contexts, the main point behind
this module is that the functions both Do What You Mean, and Do The Right
Thing, so they are most useful when you are getting params passed into your
code from someone and/or somewhere else and you can't really trust the quality.
