Lingua::Ispell::spellcheck() takes one argument. It must be a string, and it should contain
only printable characters. One allowable exception is a terminal newline, which will be
chomped off anyway. The line is fed to a coprocess running ispell for analysis. ispell
parses the line into "terms" according to the language-specific rules in effect.

The result of ispell's analysis of each term is a categorization of the term into one of
six types: ok, compound, root, miss, none, and guess. Some of these carry additional
information. The first three types are "correctly" spelled terms, and the last three are
for "incorrectly" spelled terms.

Lingua::Ispell::spellcheck returns a list of objects, each corresponding to a term in the
spellchecked string. Each object is a hash (hash-ref) with at least two entries: 'term' and
'type'. The former contains the term ispell is reporting on, and the latter is ispell's
determination of that term's type (see above). For types 'ok' and 'none', that is all the
information there is. For the type 'root', an additional hash entry is present: 'root'. Its
value is the word which ispell identified in the dictionary as being the likely root of the
current term. For the type 'miss', an additional hash entry is present: 'misses'. Its value
is an ref to an array of words which ispell identified as being "near-misses" of the
current term, when scanning the dictionary.
