cat << EOF
A lot of the speed penalty of Perl when processing multiple smallish data sets from/to text form consists of the perl compiler startup / script compilation, which accumulates when looping over a set of files. This process can be sped up a lot by keeping the pipe alive and streaming the whole file set through it once. This module helps you with that. Of course, a pipe of several scripts parsing/producing text will still be slower than a custom C program that does the job, but with this trick of avoiding repeated script interpretation/compilation, the margin is a lot smaller.

When dealing with ASCII-based text files (or UTF-8, if you please), there are some control characters that just make sense for pushing several files as a stream, separated by these characters. These are character codes 2 (STX, start of text), 3 (EOT, end of text) and 4 (ETX, end of transmission). All this module does is provide a wrapper for inserting these control characters for the sender and parsing them for the receiver. Nothing fancy, really. I just got fed up writing the same loop over and over again. It works with all textual data that does not contain control characters below decimal code 5.
