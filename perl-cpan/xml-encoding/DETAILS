cat << EOF
This module, built as a subclass of XML::Parser, parses
encoding map XML files. Included in the distribution is the
compile_encoding script that compiles these to the binary
form used by XML::Parser in order to parse scripts in the
given encoding. Also included is a script that generates
encoding map XML files from the type of mapping files
obtained at ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS.

Several encoding maps are included in the maps subdirectory.
