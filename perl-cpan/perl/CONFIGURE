	I see you've got a $PREVIOUS_VERSION perl library. This probably
	means that you're upgrading perl.

	If this is not the case you can skip the next paragraph
	and just answer no to the question...

	   Perl 5.8 is binary incompatible with previous versions
	   this means that you'll have to rebuild all installed 
	   perl spell's. I can do that for you.

	   After all spells have successfully been build you'll have to
	   remember to _MANUALLY_ remove the following directories:
	   
	      rm -rf ${INSTALL_ROOT}/usr/lib/perl5/$PREVIOUS_VERSION
	      rm -rf ${INSTALL_ROOT}/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/$PREVIOUS_VERSION
