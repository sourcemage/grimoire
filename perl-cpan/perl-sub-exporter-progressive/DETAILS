Sub::Exporter is an incredibly powerful module, but with that power comes great
responsibility, er- as well as some runtime penalties. This module is a
Sub::Exporter wrapper that will let your users just use Exporter if all they are
doing is picking exports, but use Sub::Exporter if your users try to use
Sub::Exporter's more advanced features, like renaming exports, if they try to
use them.

Note that this module will export @EXPORT, @EXPORT_OK and %EXPORT_TAGS package
variables for Exporter to work. Additionally, if your package uses advanced
Sub::Exporter features like currying, this module will only ever use
Sub::Exporter, so you might as well use it directly.
