           SHORT="Perl modules and scripts for working with numerical data stored in ascii text form"
cat << EOF
This is a set of Perl modules to work with numerical data stored in ascii text files accompanied by a collection of scripts using them.
The scripts have names like txdcalc, txdnorm, ... indicating their purpose (general calculation, normalization, ...).
Most of them are designed as filterns so that you can chain up operations easily in the shell.
