This module solves the problem of having to write a bazil­
lion get/set methods that are all the same. The argument
to 'use' is a hash whose keys are the names of types of
generic methods generated by MethodMaker and whose values
tell method maker what methods to make. (More precisely,
the keys are the names of MethodMaker methods (methods
that write methods) and the values are the arguments to
those methods.
