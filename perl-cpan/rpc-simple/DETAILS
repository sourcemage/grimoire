This module uses Tk's control loop on the local side and a IO::Select
based control loop on the server side.

To use this set of classes, the user will have to create a set of twin
classes. One will run on the local side, the other on the remote side.
Each twin class will inherit a RPC::Simple::Any[Local|Remote] class.

When done you'll be able to invoke a method from the remote class on the
local object and vice versa. (like $localObj->remotePrint).

When calling the remote method from the local side, you may pass a code
reference which will be stored by the RPC::Simple objects. This code ref will be called
back when the remote function is over. Note that the remote calls are not
blocking, all feedback from the remote side is performed through
asynchronous call-back.

Note that simultaneous remote calls on the same object (or on
different objects) are supported, you'll get the relevant call-back
as usual.

On the other hand (or side ...), the callback mechanism does not work
when calling a method from the remote side to the local side.
Only a simple method call (albeit with optionnal parameters) is allowed
from the remote side.

Note that the attribute of the twin objects are not automagically
copied or updated on the other side. You will have to explicitely
pass the necessary data from one side to the other if you need it.

See the man pages or the test.pl script to get further details.
Note you have install Tk to be able to perform the tests.

About security: When running the server, only a localhost (127.0.0.1)
connection is allowed by default. You may call a server method to allow
connections from other IP (either numeric or name) addresses. Once this is
done, the decalred address is considered as a "buddy" and the data
sent to the server are not checked for security (i.e. the Taint mechanism
is defeated). Consider yourself warned.

Note that if security is a real problem for you, you should consider using
penguin. (See CPAN). (Note also that I always opened to comments and
suggestion to improve the security aspects)

All in all, I've tried to keep things simple.
