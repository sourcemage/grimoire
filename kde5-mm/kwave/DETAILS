Kwave is a sound editor designed for the KDE4 Desktop Environment.  With Kwave
you can edit many sorts of wav-files including multi-channel files.  You are
able to alter and play back each channel on its own.  Kwave also includes
many plugins (most are still under development) to transform the wave-file
in several ways and presents a graphical view with a complete zoom and
scroll capability.
