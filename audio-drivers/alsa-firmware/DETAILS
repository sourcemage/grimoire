From http://www.alsa-project.org/intro.php3
The Advanced Linux Sound Architecture project is being developed in the
Linux operating system and is released under version 2 of the GPL (GNU
general public license) and the LGPL (GNU library general public license).

Primary goals: 

1. Create a fully modularized sound driver which supports kerneld and kmod.

2. Create the ALSA Kernel API which surpasses the current OSS API.

3. Maintain compatibility with most OSS/Lite binaries.

4. Create the ALSA Library (C, C++), which simplifies ALSA application
development.

5. Create the ALSA Manager, an interactive configuration program for
the driver.

Lastly, this sorcery spell supports one and only one sound card.
If you have more or it is ISA, then you will likely have to create
a custom spell.
