Honeyd is a small daemon that creates virtual hosts on a network. The hosts
can be
configured to run arbitrary services, and their TCP personality can be
adapted so
that they appear to be running certain versions of operating systems. Honeyd
enables a single host to claim multiple addresses on a LAN for network
simulation.
It is possible to ping the virtual machines, or to traceroute them. Any type of
service on the virtual machine can be simulated according to a simple
configuration
file. Instead of simulating a service, it is also possible to proxy it
to another
machine.
