cat << EOF
srm is a secure replacement for rm(1). Unlike the standard rm, it 
overwrites the data in the target files before unlinking them. This 
prevents command-line recovery of the data by examining the raw block 
device. It may also help frustrate physical examination of the disk, 
although it's unlikely that it can completely prevent that type of 
recovery. It is, essentially, a paper shredder for sensitive files.
srm is ideal for personal computers or workstations with Internet 
connections. It can help prevent malicious users from breaking in and 
undeleting personal files, such as old emails. It's also useful for 
permanently removing files from expensive media. For example, cleaning 
your diary off the zip disk you're using to send vacation pictures to 
Uncle Lou. Because it uses the exact same options as rm(1), srm is simple 
to use. Just subsitute it for rm whenever you want to destroy files, 
rather than just unlinking them.
