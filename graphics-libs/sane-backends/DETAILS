SANE stands for "Scanner Access Now Easy" and is an application 
programming interface (API) that provides standardized access to 
any raster image scanner hardware (flatbed scanner, hand-held 
scanner, video- and still-cameras, frame-grabbers, etc.). 
The SANE API is public domain and its discussion and development 
is open to everybody.
