cat << EOF
Glitz is a portable 2D graphics library that uses OpenGL to render hardware
accelerated graphics. It supports many of the latest OpenGL features, such as
efficient off-screen rendering using pbuffers. Rendering can be carried out by
arbitrary OpenGL layers, thanks to glitz's extensible backend system. Glitz is
designed to match the X Render Extension semantics and provides a general way
for accelerating this imaging model. Glitz can be used as a stand-alone layer
above OpenGL but is also designed to act as a backend for cairo, providing it
with OpenGL accelerated output.
