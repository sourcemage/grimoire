cat << EOF
fcft is a small font loading and glyph rasterization library built on-top of
FontConfig, FreeType2 and pixman.

It can load and cache fonts from a fontconfig-formatted name string, e.g.
Monospace:size=12, optionally with user configured fallback fonts.

After a font has been loaded, you can rasterize glyphs. When doing so,
the primary font is first considered. If it does not have the requested glyph,
the user configured fallback fonts (if any) are considered. If none of
the user configured fallback fonts has the requested glyph, the FontConfig
generated list of fallback fonts are checked.

The API is documented as man pages. These are built and installed when fcft is
built as a standalone project, but not when built as a subproject.
