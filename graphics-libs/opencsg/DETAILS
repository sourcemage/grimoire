cat << EOF
OpenCSG is a library that does image-based CSG rendering using OpenGL. CSG is
short for Constructive Solid Geometry and denotes an approach to model complex
3D-shapes using simpler ones. I.e., two shapes can be combined by taking the
union of them, by intersecting them, or by subtracting one shape of the other.
