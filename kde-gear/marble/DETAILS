Marble is a virtual globe and world atlas â€” your swiss army knife for maps. Find 
your way and explore the world!
Versatile, yet easy to use. Use Marble similar to a desktop globe; pan around and 
measure distances. At closer scale it becomes a world atlas, while OpenStreetMap 
takes you to street level. Search for places of interest, view Wikipedia articles, 
create routes by drag and drop and so much more.
