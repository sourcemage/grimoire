cat << EOF
Ncdc is a modern and lightweight direct connect client with a friendly ncurses
interface.

Common features all modern DC clients (should) have:
 o Connecting to multiple hubs at the same time,
 o Support for both ADC and NMDC protocols,
 o Chatting and private messaging,
 o Browsing the user list of a connected hub,
 o Share management and file uploading,
 o Connections and download queue management,
 o File list browsing,
 o Multi-source and TTH-checked file downloading,
 o Searching for files,
 o Secure hub (adcs:// and nmdcs://) and client connections on both protocols,
 o Bandwidth throttling.

And special features not commonly found in other clients:
 o Different connection settings for each hub,
 o Encrypted UDP messages (ADC SUDP),
 o Subdirectory refreshing,
 o Nick notification and highlighting in chat windows,
 o Trust on First Use for TLS-enabled hubs,
 o A single listen port for both TLS and TCP connections,
 o Efficient file uploads using sendfile(),
 o Large file lists are opened in a background thread,
 o Doesn't trash your OS file cache (with the flush_file_cache option enabled),
 o (Relatively...) low memory usage.
