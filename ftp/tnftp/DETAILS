 * command-line editing within ftp

   - http proxies
   - authentication
 * configurable prompt
 * context sensitive command and filename completion
 * dynamic progress bar
 * feature negotiation extensions from RFC 2389
 * extensions to ftp from the IETF ftpext working group
 * IPv6 support (from the WIDE project)
 * modification time preservation
 * paging of local and remote files, and of directory listings
 * passive mode support, with fallback to active mode
 * retrieval of filenames listed in a given file
 * overriding of ftp environment variables
 * TIS Firewall Toolkit gate ftp proxy support
 * transfer-rate throttling
 * uploading of files on the command line
 * (Dante) SOCKS5 support
