cat << EOF
With BTFS, you can mount any .torrent file or magnet link and then use it as
any read-only directory in your file tree. The contents of the files will
be downloaded on-demand as they are read by applications. Tools like ls,
cat and cp works as expected. Applications like vlc and mplayer can also
work without changes.
