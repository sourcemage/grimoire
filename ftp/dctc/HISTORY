	* Bumped version to 0.80.5

2002-04-21 Eric Schabell <eric@schabell.com>
	* Updated version to 0.80.0:
	* In this version, the upload slots are now shared by all running
	  clients. A corruption and crash problem occurring in UADDR with
	  Berkeley DB was fixed. When a remote user retrieves the share list,
	  DCTC now waits up to 15 minutes before closing the transfer
	  connection. In the GUI, a preference reload problem was fixed and the
	  done tab now sorts numerically. The Content search tab has been
	  removed.

2002-04-21 ^GiuAnZ^ <djcomputer@gmx.net>
	* Bug fix for building dctc:
	  The source is named dctc-0.79.0.tar.gz, but the tarball contains the
	  directory dctc-0.79.1. So the spell fails to compile as it unpacks in the
	  wrong path. A temporary fix (at least until the author releases a new
	  version) is setting this in the DETAILS file:
	  VERSION=0.79.1
	  SOURCE=$SPELL-0.79.0.tar.gz

2002-04-12 Eric Schabell <eric@schabell.com>
	* Updated version to 0.79.0:
	* In this version, UADDR now uses BerkeleyDB, "normal" download function
	  is replaced by a wrapper to GDL functions. Speed computation is more
	  accurate. DCTC can wake up waiting tasks when a user having a
	  "searched" nickname comes into the hub or has a free download slot. A
	  man page was added, along with a command to find out which hub a user
	  is on, and a virtual share.

2002-04-07 Eric Schabell <eric@schabell.com>
	* Updated version to 0.78.0:
	* In this release, the BerkeleyDB detection was improved. The transfer
	  key of broken clients can now be accepted. When a transfer with an
	  user ends, other waiting transfers with him are now woken up. Minor
	  bugs were fixed in download and search. It is now possible to link
	  DCTCs of different computers to allow them to share the user IP
	  address database (UADDR) and to perform searchs on hub where you are
	  not directly connected to. With the GUI, users can now be flagged from
	  GDL list, the seen hub list is saved faster on leaving, each GDL has a
	  time to complete its task, and the user share list is displayed as a
	  tree and is now buffered to improve display speed.

2002-04-02 Eric Schabell <eric@schabell.com>
	* Updated version to 0.77.0:
	* Support for Berkeley Database 4.0, ability to limit the download
	  bandwidth and GDL gathering speed, a fix for a GUI bug preventing new
	  users from starting, ability to attach all unused GDLs to the client
	  in one click, and running clients can be terminated (or killed)
	  without being connected to.

2002-03-25 Eric Schabell <eric@schabell.com>
	* Updated version to 0.76.0:
	* Dutch translation of the GDL and BerkeleyDB 
	  documentations added by MyckelHabets.
	* Fix a severe security bug in the function 
	  handling download. Due to a missing character
	  in the C code, it is possible to download any 
	  file, shared or not as long as you know its name.
	  Problem notified by Morra.
	* When the client was disconnected from the hub, the 
	  previous version resets the number of GDL of the global
	  status file. The problem has been fixed.
	* new commands added: /HIDE_KICK, /SHOW_KICK. Enable/disable 
	  hub-security global chat kick message deletion.To limit
	  pollution of global chat, I suggest you discard these 
	  annoying messages.
	* An UI can now send DCTC commands in client udp socket 
	  used by DCTC link.
	* minor error message fixed in berkeley database initialization. 
	  DCTC should no more crash when database creation fails.

2002-03-18 Eric Schabell <eric@schabell.com>
	* Updated verson to 0.75.0: 
	  This version now avoids periodic resend of 
	  unchanged MyINFO messages. Remote users can
	  be "flagged" in order to ignore one or more events
	  generated by them, and a new command was added 
	  in the transfer protocol.

2002-03-14 Eric Schabell <eric@schabell.com>
	* Updated version to 0.74.0, thanks to Thomas Stewart.
