Scilab is a scientific software package for numerical computations in a user-friendly environment. It features:

    * Elaborate data structures (polynomial, rational and string matrices, lists, multivariable linear systems,...).
    * Sophisticated interpreter and programming language with Matlab-like syntax.
    * Hundreds of built-in math functions (new primitives can easily be added).
    * Stunning graphics (2d, 3d, animation).
    * Open structure (easy interfacing with Fortran and C via online dynamic link).
    * Many built-in libraries:

    * Linear Algebra (including sparse matrices, Kronecker form, ordered Schur,...).
    * Control (Classical, LQG, H-infinity,...).
    * Package for LMI (Linear Matrix Inequalities) optimization.
    * Signal processing.
    * Simulation (various ode's, dassl,...).
    * Optimization (differentiable and non-differentiable, LQ solver).
    * Scicos, an interactive environment for modeling and simulation of dynamical systems.
    * Metanet (network analysis and optimization).

    * Symbolic capabilities through Maple interface.
    * Parallel Scilab.
