Gwyddion is a modular program for SPM (scanning probe microscopy) data
visualization and analysis. Primarily it is intended for the analysis of height
fields obtained by scanning probe microscopy techniques (AFM, MFM, STM,
SNOM/NSOM) and it supports a lot of SPM data formats. However, it can be used
for general height field and (greyscale) image processing, for instance for the
analysis of profilometry data or thickness maps from imaging spectrophotometry.

Gwyddion provides a large number of data processing functions, including all the
standard statistical characterization, levelling and data correction, filtering
or grain marking functions. And since the developers are active SPM users, the
program also contains a number of specific, uncommon, odd and experimental data
processing methods they found useful â€“ and you may find them useful too.

It aims to provide a modular program for 2D data processing and analysis that
can be easily extended by third-party modules and scripts. Moreover, thanks to
being free software, it provides the source code to developers and users, which
makes easier both verification of its data processing algorithms and further
program improvements.
