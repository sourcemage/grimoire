2009-06-18 David Kowis <dkowis@shlrm.org>

2006-05-17 Eric Sandall <sandalle@sourcemage.org>
	* shmem-type-cast-presision-loss.patch: Removed (now uses (long)p)
	* PRE_BUILD: No longer try to apply shmem-type-cast-presision-loss.patch

2006-03-28 Eric Sandall <sandalle@sourcemage.org>
	* DETAILS: Added PATCHLEVEL so people get the boinc init script (if they
	  haven't already) and so people with the current init script get the fixed
	  version (also so wxgtk-no-unicode gets marked as optional ;)).
	  Set PATCHLEVEL=2 for yet more changes/fixes
	* CONFIGURE: Ask if the user wants boinc_client-cvs setuid (for it to work
	  'out of the box' this defaults to 'y').
	* DEPENDS: Made wxgtk-no-unicode optional (again...)
	  Added missing '&&' after first if/fi
	  Added dependencies on zlib and openssl
	  Note that the usage of libdn is through curl, not directly through boinc
	* PRE_BUILD,BUILD: Moved create_account from BUILD to PRE_BUILD
	* INSTALL: Setuid/setgid /usr/bin/boinc_client-cvs (if the user wants us to)
	* init.d/boinc: BOINC_PRAMS -> BOINC_PARMS
	  Removed unecessary '-r' in rm for PIDFILE
	  Removed the usage of `su`, the client now runs as the user who runs it
	  (or 'boinc' if the user answered 'y' to making it setuid)
	  No longer need to cd to $BOINC_HOME
	  Replace $NAME with 'boinc' as that's the name of the script, not
	  boinc_client-cvs
	  Added restart()
	* init.d/boinc.conf: Removed BOINC_USER variable (no longer used)

2006-03-26 David Brown <dmlb2000@gmail.com>
	* PRE_BUILD: added patch for loss of presision when type casting a void
	  pointer to an int
	* shmem-type-cast-presision-loss.patch: the loss of presision shows up
	  on x86-64 machines where a void pointer is different size from an int

2006-03-26 David Brown <dmlb2000@gmail.com>
	* DEPENDS: not elif but just plain if
	* BUILD: added program suffix to because /usr/bin/start
