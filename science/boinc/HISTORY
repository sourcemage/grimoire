2006-03-28 Eric Sandall <sandalle@sourcemage.org>
	* DETAILS: Added PATCHLEVEL so people get the boinc init script (if they
	  haven't already) and so people with the current init script get the fixed
	  version (also so wxgtk-no-unicode gets marked as optional ;)).
	  Set PATCHLEVEL=2 for yet more changes/fixes
	* CONFIGURE: Ask if the user wants boinc_client-cvs setuid (for it to work
	  'out of the box' this defaults to 'y').

	  (or 'boinc' if the user answered 'y' to making it setuid)

	  Replace $NAME with 'boinc' as that's the name of the script, not
	  boinc_client-cvs
