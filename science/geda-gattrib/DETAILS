Gattrib is gEDA's attribute editor. It reads a set of gschem .sch files
(schematic files), and creates a spreadsheet showing all components in rows,
with the associated component attributes listed in the columns. It allows the
user to add, modify, or delete component attributes outside of gschem, and then
save the .sch files back out. When it is completed, it will allow the user to
edit attributes attached to components, nets, and pins. (Currently, only
component attribute editing is implemented; pin attributes are displayed only,
and net attributes are TBD.)

Gattrib is useful in situations where you need to view, add, modify, or delete a
number of attributes all at once. It saves you the pain of clicking on each
component and repeatedly using gschem's attribute editor to modify component
attributes. For example, if you create a large design with generic components,
and then later want to attach "footprint" attributes to your components, it is
a real hassle to do so using gschem. In this situation, you can run gattrib on
your design files to attach the "footprint" attributes all at once using an
easy-to-use spreadsheet.
