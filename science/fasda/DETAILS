cat << EOF
FASDA aims to provide a fast and simple differential analysis tool that just
works and does not require any knowledge beyond basic Unix command-line
skills. It operates on a simple command-line interface (CLI) analogous
to popular tools such as bedtools, BWA, and samtools. The code is written
entirely in C and built on biolibc to maximize efficiency and portability.
