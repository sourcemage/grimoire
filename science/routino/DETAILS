Routino is an application for finding a route between two points using the
dataset of topographical information collected by http://www.OpenStreetMap.org.

This router uses a routing algorithm that takes OSM format data as its input
and calculates either the shortest or quickest route between two points. To
optimise the routing a custom database format is used. This allows the
routing to be performed quickly after a modest one-off pre-processing stage.

A selection is possible for any of the major OSM transport types and for each
of the main OSM highway types a preference can be provided and a speed limit.
Restrictions on one-way streets, weight, height, width and length are also
options. Further preferences about road properties (e.g. paved or not)
can also be selected.

The processing of the input XML file is based on rules in a configuration file
that transform the highway tags into tags that are understood by Routino. The
generation of the output files (HTML and GPX) uses language fragments selected
from another configuration file which allows multi-lingual output from the
same database.

The router takes into account private/public/permissive restrictions on
highways as well as tagged speed limits and barriers (gates, bollards). The
simplest and most common turn restriction relations (those composed of a way,
node and way) are also supported.
