CGAL is a software project that provides easy access to efficient and reliable
geometric algorithms in the form of a C++ library. CGAL is used in various
areas needing geometric computation, such as geographic information systems,
computer aided design, molecular biology, medical imaging, computer graphics,
and robotics.

The library offers data structures and algorithms like triangulations, Voronoi
diagrams, Boolean operations on polygons and polyhedra, point set processing,
arrangements of curves, surface and volume mesh generation, geometry
processing, alpha shapes, convex hull algorithms, shape reconstruction,
AABB and KD trees.
