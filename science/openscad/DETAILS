OpenSCAD is a free software application for creating solid 3D CAD
(computer-aided design) objects. It is a script-only based modeller that
uses its own description language; parts can be previewed, but it cannot be
interactively selected or modified by mouse in the 3D view. An OpenSCAD script
specifies geometric primitives (such as spheres, boxes, cylinders, etc.) and
defines how they are modified and combined (for instance by intersection,
difference, envelope combination and Minkowski sums) to render a 3D model.
As such, the program does constructive solid geometry (CSG).
