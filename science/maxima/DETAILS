cat << EOF
Maxima is a Common Lisp implementation of MIT's Macsyma system for computer
based algebra. Maxima is now about to be released under the GNU Public License.

    * Plotting via netmath over the network.
    * Computations over network
    * Well tested on a large array of problems.
    * Source level Debugger for maxima code
    * Documentation available as html, or texinfo and so info, and so dvi
      and postscript.
    * Latest source development version available or look here for how to
      download using cvs.
    * Easy to extend in fundamentally new ways, because you have complete
      access to source, and access to Common Lisp.
    * Portable to many systems.
    * Now covered by GNU public license, so it will stay free.
    * Was the first computer algebra system, and is one of the best.
    * It is possible to evaluate forms from web pages in local maxima or in
      remote ones. Also to access pari, octave, and gap from netmath.
