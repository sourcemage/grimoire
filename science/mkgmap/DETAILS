The mkgmap program takes OpenStreetMap data and generates a map in the Garmin
.img file format so that it can be loaded onto compatible GPS units.

* Generates a map directly from a file saved from JOSM or from an extract of
  the main OSM planet file.
* Converts several .osm files in one run of the program to create a map tile
  set.
* Creates a .tdb file and an overview map that can be used to view the maps in
  MapSource or QLandkarte.
* Creates a gmapsupp.img file that can be copied directly to an SD card.  *
Can also combine previously produced .img files into one gmapsupp.img file.
* Create a .tdb and overview map from previously produced .img files.  *
The mapping between OSM features features in the Garmin map can be
  customised.
* Transliteration of characters to ascii where that is possible to enable
  viewing on low end devices or for international maps.
* Character set can be specified for display on capable GPS devices.  *
Control over the zoom levels that any feature appears at.

The program does not send the created maps to the GPS unit. This can be done
with another program such as sendmap or qlandkarte gt. If your GPS device
has a removable SD card, then you can just create a gmapsupp.img file and
copy it to the cards in the Garmin directory.
