Portable SDK for UPnP Devices (libupnp) provides developers with an API and
code for building control points, devices, and bridges that are compliant
with Version 1.0 of the Universal Plug and Play Device Architecture
Specification. This allows discovery, event notification, and control of
devices on a network, independent of operating system, programming language,
or physical network connection.
