cat << EOF
Libnet is a high-level API (toolkit) allowing the application programmer 
to construct and inject network packets. It provides a portable and 
simplified interface for low-level network packet shaping, handling and 
injection. Libnet hides much of the tedium of packet creation from the 
application programmer such as multiplexing, buffer management, arcane 
packet header information, byte-ordering, OS-dependent issues, and much 
more. Libnet features portable packet creation interfaces at the IP layer 
and link layer, as well as a host of supplementary and complementary 
functionality. Using libnet, quick and simple packet assembly 
applications can be whipped up with little effort. With a bit more time, 
more complex programs can be written (Traceroute and ping were easily 
rewritten using libnet and libpcap).
