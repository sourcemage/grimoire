           SHORT="Netpipes is a package to manipulate BSD TCP/IP stream sockets"
cat << EOF
The netpipes package makes TCP/IP streams usable in shell scripts. It can also 
simplify client/server code by allowing the programmer to skip all the tedious 
programming bits related to sockets and concentrate on writing a filter/service.

"Why would anyone want to do that?"
