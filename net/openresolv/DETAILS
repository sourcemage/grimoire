openresolv is a resolvconf implementation which manages resolv.conf.

This resolvconf implementation, along with its subscribers, work with a POSIX
compliant shell and userland utilities. It is designed to work without tools
such as sed as it *has* to work without /usr being available.

On systems where resolvconf is expected to be used before /var/run is available
for writing, you can configure openresolv to write somewhere else, like say a
ramdisk.
