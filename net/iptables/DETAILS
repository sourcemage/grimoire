iptables is the userspace command line program used to configure the Linux 2.4.x
and 2.6.x IPv4 packet filtering ruleset. It is targeted towards system
administrators.

Since Network Address Translation is also configured from the packet filter
ruleset, iptables is used for this, too.

The iptables package also includes ip6tables. ip6tables is used for configuring
the IPv6 packet filter.

Main features:
 * listing the contents of the packet filter ruleset
 * adding/removing/modifying rules in the packet filter ruleset
 * listing/zeroing per-rule counters of the packet filter ruleset
