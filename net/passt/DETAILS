passt implements a translation layer between a Layer-2 network interface and
native Layer-4 sockets (TCP, UDP, ICMP/ICMPv6 echo) on a host. It doesn't
require any capabilities or privileges, and it can be used as a simple
replacement for Slirp.

pasta (same binary as passt, different command) offers equivalent
functionality, for network namespaces: traffic is forwarded using a tap
interface inside the namespace, without the need to create further interfaces
on the host, hence not requiring any capabilities or privileges.

It also implements a tap bypass path for local connections: packets with
a local destination address are moved directly between Layer-4 sockets,
avoiding Layer-2 translations, using the splice(2) and recvmmsg(2)/sendmmsg(2)
system calls for TCP and UDP, respectively.
