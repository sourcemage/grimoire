           SHORT="driftnet - watches network traffic and picks out and displays images"
cat << EOF
Driftnet watches network traffic, and picks out 
and displays JPEG and GIF images for display. 
It is an horrific invasion of privacy and shouldn't 
be used by anyone anywhere. It can also extract MPEG 
audio data from the network and play it.
