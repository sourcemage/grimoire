PIKT is a cross-categorical, multi-purpose toolkit for monitoring and 
configuring computer systems, organizing system security, formatting 
documents, assisting command-line work, and performing other common 
system administration tasks. Its primary purpose is to report on and 
fix problems, but its flexibility and extendibility evoke many other 
uses limited only by your imagination.
