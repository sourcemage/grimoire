cat << EOF
This is a handy little library which provides a packet filtering mechanism based
on the BSD packet filter (BPF). Most notably, tcpdump needs this to work, and
there is also a perl module (still in beta) which can use this as well. In plain
english, if you want to write your own network traffic analyzer, this is the
place to start.
