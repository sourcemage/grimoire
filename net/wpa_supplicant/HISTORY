	* CONFIGURE: Sanitizations and corrections. Commented out  
	  CONFIG_WIRELESS_EXTENSIONS as it is automatical anyway. 
	  Commented out driver option for Hermes, as that requires 
	  copying stuff from another tarball. Commented out madwifi and 
	  broadcom drivers, for some reason they break compile. Added 
	  query for GUI. Disabled CONFIG_CTRL_IFACE if building devel 
	  version, it breaks compile.
