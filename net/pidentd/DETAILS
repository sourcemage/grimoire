cat << EOF
Identd is a program that implements the RFC1413 identification server.
It was very much inspired by Dan Bernstein's original 'authd' (but
unlike that program doesn't use 'netstat' to get some of the
information) It uses the kernel information directly. (And is due to
that fact a lot faster). Dan has now written another version of the
'authd' daemon that uses his 'kstuff' to read the kernel information.
Unlike that daemon, this will use only normally available kernel access
functions (and is due to that more limited in the different machines it
support). Please note that this daemon used to be called pauthd but has
changed name to better reflect what it does (and to conform to the new
RFC).
