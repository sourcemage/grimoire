cat << EOF
NNG, like its predecessors nanomsg (and to some extent ZeroMQ), is a
lightweight, broker-less library, offering a simple API to solve common
recurring messaging problems, such as publish/subscribe, RPC-style
request/reply, or service discovery. The API frees the programmer from
worrying about details like connection management, retries, and other common
considerations, so that they can focus on the application instead of the
plumbing.
