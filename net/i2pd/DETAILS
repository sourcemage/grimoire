i2pd (I2P Daemon) is a full-featured C++ implementation of I2P client.

I2P (Invisible Internet Protocol) is a universal anonymous network layer. All
communications over I2P are anonymous and end-to-end encrypted, participants
don't reveal their real IP addresses.

I2P client is a software used for building and using anonymous I2P networks.
Such networks are commonly used for anonymous peer-to-peer applications
(filesharing, cryptocurrencies) and anonymous client-server applications
(websites, instant messengers, chat-servers).

I2P allows people from all around the world to communicate and share information
without restrictions.
