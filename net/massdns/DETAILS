If you are running a high-load WEB server a worry about its efficiency, you most 
probably have turned off reverse IP lookups for the logs, because using reverse 
DNS to map a raw IP to a name is quite the resource waster.
       
This means that your http access logs are full of things like 234.54.122.31, but 
you have no idea who actually came knocking.
		       
Once in a while, you would like to take that log and batch process it (maybe on 
another machine) to convert those IP's back to names.
			       
This is precisely what massdns does.
