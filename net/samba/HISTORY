	* DETAILS: Updated to 2.2.7
	  IMPORTANT: Security bugfix for Samba
	  *-----------------------------------
	  Summary
	  A security hole has been discovered in versions 2.2.2 through 2.2.6
	  of Samba that could potentially allow an attacker to gain root
	  access on the target machine. The word "potentially" is used because
	  there is no known exploit of this bug, and the Samba Team has not
	  been able to craft one ourselves. However, the seriousness of the
	  problem warrants this immediate 2.2.7 release. In addition to
	  addressing this security issue, Samba 2.2.7 also includes thirteen
	  unrelated improvements. These improvements result from our process
	  of continuous quality assurance and code review, and are part of the
	  Samba team's commitment to excellence. There was a bug in the length
	  checking for encrypted password change requests from clients. A
	  client could potentially send an encrypted password, which, when
	  decrypted with the old hashed password could be used as a buffer
	  overrun attack on the stack of smbd. The attach would have to be
	  crafted such that converting a DOS codepage string to little endian
	  UCS2 unicode would translate into an executable block of code. All
	  versions of Samba between 2.2.2 to 2.2.6 inclusive are vulnerable to
	  this problem. This version of Samba 2.2.7 contains a fix for this
	  problem. Earlier versions of Samba are not vulnerable.
