This is a roll up package so that you can still cast "shorewall" to get it
all installed easily.
The Shoreline Firewall, more commonly known as "Shorewall", is a high-level
tool for configuring Netfilter. You describe your firewall/gateway
requirements using entries in a set of configuration files. Shorewall reads
those configuration files and with the help of the iptables utility, Shorewall
configures Netfilter to match your requirements. Shorewall can be used on a
dedicated firewall system, a multi-function gateway/router/server or on a
standalone GNU/Linux system. Shorewall does not use Netfilter's ipchains
compatibility mode and can thus take advantage of Netfilter's connection state
tracking capabilities.
