Jigsaw Download, or short jigdo, is a tool designed to ease the distribution of
very large files over the internet, for example CD or DVD images. Its aim is to
make downloading the images as easy for users as a click on a direct download
link in a browser, while avoiding all the problems that server administrators
have with hosting such large files.
