IFStatus was developed for Linux users that are usually in console mode.
It is a simple, easy to use program for displaying commonly needed / wanted 
statistics in real time about ingoing and outgoing traffic of multiple network
interfaces that are usually hard to find, with a simple and efficient view.
It is a substitute for the PPPStatus and EthStatus projects.
