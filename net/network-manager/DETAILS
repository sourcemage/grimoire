The GNOME NetworkManager is a set of co-operative tools that make networking
simple and straightforward. Whether wireless or wired, NetworkManager allows
you to quickly move from one network to another: once a network has been
configured and joined once, it can be detected and re-joined automatically at
a later date. It was designed to auto-detect as much information as possible,
seamlessly switches connections when necessary, and provides immediate feedback
of the network state to users and applications. It utilizes D-Bus and HAL.
