cat << EOF
IP sets are a framework inside the Linux 2.4.x and 2.6.x kernel, which can be
administered by the ipset utility. Depending on the type, currently an IP set
may store IP addresses, (TCP/UDP) port numbers or IP addresses with MAC
addresses in a way, which ensures lightning speed when matching an entry
against a set.

If you want to
 * store multiple IP addresses or port numbers and match against the collection
   by iptables at one swoop;
 * dynamically update iptables rules against IP addresses or ports without
   performance penalty;
 * express complex IP address and ports based rulesets with one single iptables
   rule and benefit from the speed of IP sets

then ipset may be the proper tool for you.
