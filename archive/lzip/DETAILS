cat << EOF
Lzip is a lossless data compressor based on the LZMA algorithm, with very
safe integrity
checking and a user interface similar to the one of gzip or bzip2. Lzip
decompresses almost
as fast as gzip and compresses better than bzip2, which makes it well suited
for software
distribution and data archiving.
