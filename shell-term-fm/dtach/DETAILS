dtach is a tiny program that emulates the detach feature of screen, allowing
you to run a program in an environment that is protected from the controlling
terminal and attach to it later. dtach does not keep track of the contents
of the screen, and thus works best with programs that know how to redraw
themselves.

dtach does not, however, have the other features of screen, such as its
support of multiple terminals or its terminal emulation support. This makes
dtach extremely tiny compared to screen, making it more easily audited for
bugs and security holes, and also allows it to fit in environments where
space is limited, such as on rescue disks.

dtach has many possible uses, even though it is tiny. With dtach, you can:

    * Attach multiple times to the same program. Access to the dtach session
      is controlled through the Unix filesystem permissions; thus, you can
      trivially allow other people to watch your session.

    * Run a program in an environment that is protected from the controlling
      terminal. This means that, for instance, the program running under dtach
      would not be affected by the terminal being disconnected for some
      reason.

    * Run programs such as emacs, which tend to want full control over the
      terminal. dtach mostly acts as a relay, and does not mangle the text
      between the application and your terminal.

    * Suspend dtach without suspending the running program. dtach can handle
      the suspend key itself instead of passing it to the running program,
      which may be useful for certain programs such as ircII.
