UnixTree is a powerful and versatile console-mode filemanager for Unix and
Linux systems, modeled very closely after the distinguished DOS program
XTreeGold.
It provides both a fast and catchy interface for daily file and directory
maintenance needs, as well as the ability to perform sophisticated tasks
on arbitrary selections of particular files all across the directory tree.
Equivalents of UNIX commands like tar, find and grep are accessible through
handy single keystroke commands. Statistical data is displayed all the time
and updated on every action taking place. UnixTree also supports archive
(tar/gz) and FTP logging, furthermore there is an "Application Menu" which
facilitates unlimited, user-defined command extensions.
Due to its heritage as the former "xtree for UNIX Systems" version,
UnixTree is now remarkable as well for its ease of use, clarity of
organization, and multitude of services, as XTreeGold has been.
UnixTree is written by Rob Juergens and is "Free Software",
released as "Open Source" under the terms of the GNU General Public License.
