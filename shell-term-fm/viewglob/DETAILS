Viewglob is a tool to increase the usability of the Unix shell by leveraging
the expressiveness of graphical environments. It sits as a layer beneath an
xterm and watches your bash or zsh shell activity as you type. A GTK+ display
shows the layout of relevant directories and highlights file selections and
potential name completions.
