bash programmable completion.
Since v2.04, bash has allowed you to intelligently program and extend
its standard completion behavior to achieve complex command lines with
just a few keystrokes. Imagine typing ssh [Tab] and being able to
complete on hosts from your ~/.ssh/known_hosts files. Or typing
man 3 str [Tab] and getting a list of all string handling functions in
the UNIX manual. mount system: [Tab] would complete on all exported
file-systems from the host called system, while make [Tab] would
complete on all targets in Makefile. This project was conceived to
produce programmable completion routines for the most common Linux/UNIX
commands, reducing the amount of typing sysadmins and programmers need
to do on a daily basis.

NOTE: The code to start completion is installed in
/etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh
      Existing users might need sourcing /etc/profile.d/* added manually.
      New users will have it automatically added.

      The SMGL specific completions are adapted from a patch by
      Lunar_fr (lunar@l-a-p.org).
