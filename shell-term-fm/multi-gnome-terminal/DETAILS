Multi Gnome Terminal is a powered and extended version of 
gnome terminal, which supports many terminals in each window, 
fast switching between different terminals using shortcuts, 
and much more. All these extensions are inspired by screen 
and konsole (the terminal emulator of kde2). Each hidden 
terminal also shows in its tab its state (i.e., whether it's 
changing or it's changed or nothing's happened).
