Grisbi is a personnal accounting application running under Linux, written
with Gnome and
Gtk, and is released under the GPL licence.

Our aim is to provide you with the most simple and intuitive software for
basic use, and
still very powerful if you spend a little time on the setup.

Grisbi is an application written by French developpers, so it perfectly
respects French
accounting rules. Grisbi can manage multiple accounts, currencies and
users. It manages
third party, expenditure and receipt categories, as well as budgetary lines,
financial
years, and other informations that makes it quite adapted for associations
(except those
that require double entry accounting). The exhaustive list of Grisbi's
functionalities can
be found in the User's guide, paragraph 1.2.
