This is a Gnome applet to allow easy access to various search engines (like
Google's Deskbar for Windows).

The goal of DeskbarApplet is to provide an omnipresent versatile search
interface. By typing search terms into the deskbar entry in your panel you
are presented with the search results as you type.

Seaches are handled by a series of plugins. DeskbarApplet provides a simple
interface to manage these plugins to provide you with the search results
that fit your needs.
