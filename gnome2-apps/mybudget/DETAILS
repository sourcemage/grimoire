The aim of the program is to make it as easy as possible for people 
to do their own personal budgets and keep track of their finances. 
Using this program you can:

    * Create a budget and organize budget items into categories.
    * Nominate budget items to be paid from either a cash account 
      or via a "Direct Debit" account which allows you to save for 
      big ticket items and ensure timely payment of scheduled bills.
    * Automatically calculates how much money you must put aside each 
      fortnight to meet all your "Direct Debit" obligations.
    * Automatically tells you how much money you must have in Direct 
      Debit account to meet your obligatory payments on any particular 
      date.
    * Record and save expenses against each of your budget categories.
    * Track how your expenses relate to your budget so you can determine 
      if you are over or under-spending in any of your categories.
    * Sort your records into categories or by date.
    * Allows you to export any of your reports, records and budget to 
      the Gnumeric Spreadsheet program where they can be either printed 
      or used for more detailed analysis.
