The Quick Lounge applet is an applet for the GNOME Panel.
Applets are little applications embedded in the Panel.
With this applet you can organize your preferred applications
in a single place.
You can add spaces between applications, they can
be used to group together applications with similar tasks.
When the applet size exceeds the available space
a menu containing the remaing launchers is created.
The menu can be accessed pressing the arrow button
located at the end of the applet. The menu displays
spaces as separators.
