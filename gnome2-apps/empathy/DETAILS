Empathy is a messaging program which supports text, voice, and video chat
and file transfers over many different protocols. You can tell it about your
accounts on all those services and do all your chatting within one application.

Empathy uses Telepathy for protocol support and has a user interface based
on Gossip. Empathy is the default chat client in current versions of GNOME,
making it easier for other GNOME applications to integrate collaboration
functionality using Telepathy.
