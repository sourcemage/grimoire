Dia is a program for creating diagrams of all kinds. The current version can do
UML class diagrams, Entity-Relationship modeling, network diagrams, and much
more. The engine is very flexible and dynamically loads diagram-types from disk.
It can currently export to PostScript and load/save in an XML format.
