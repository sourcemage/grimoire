cat << EOF
The Fibonacci series is constructed using the
formula:
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F (n - 2),
By convention F(0) = 0, and F(1) = 1.
An alternative formula that uses the Golden
Ratio can also be used:
F(n) = (PHI^n - phi^n)/sqrt(5) [Lucas'
formula],
where PHI = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 is the Golden Ratio,
and
phi = (1 - sqrt(5))/2 is its reciprocal
Requires Math_Integer, and can be used with big
integers if the GMP or
the BCMATH libraries are present.
