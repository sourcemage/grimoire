cat << EOF
Matrices are represented as 2 dimensional arrays
of numbers.
This class defines methods for matrix objects,
as well as static methods
to read, write and manipulate matrices,
including methods to solve systems
of linear equations (with and without iterative
error correction).
Requires the Math_Vector package.
For running the unit tests you will need
PHPUnit version 0.6.2 or older.
