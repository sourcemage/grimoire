cat << EOF
Classes that represent and manipulate
quaternions. Contain definitions
for basic arithmetic functions in a static
class.
Quaternions are an extension of the idea of
complex numbers, and
a quaternion is defined as:
q = a + b*i + c*j + d*k
In 1844 Hamilton described a system in which
numbers were composed of
a real part and 3 imaginary and independent
parts (i,j,k), such that:
i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = -1       and
ij = k, jk = i, ki = j     and
ji = -k, kj = -i, ik = -j
The above are known as "Hamilton's rules"
