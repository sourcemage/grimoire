cat << EOF
Originally part of the 1.4.0 new features,
remote installation through FTP is now its own
package.
This package adds the commands "remote-install"
"remote-upgrade"
"remote-uninstall" and "remote-upgrade-all" to
the PEAR core.
To take advantage, you must have a config file
on the remote
ftp server and full access to the server to
create and remove
files.  The config-create command can be used
to get started,
and the remote_config configuration variable is
set to the
full URL as in
"ftp://ftp.example.com/path/to/pear.ini"
After this is done, install/upgrade as normal
using the
remote* commands as if they were local.
