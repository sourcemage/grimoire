The template engine is a compiling engine, all
templates are compiled into PHP-files.
This will make the delivery of the files faster
on the next request, since the template
doesn't need to be compiled again. If the
template changes it will be recompiled.

There is no new template language to learn.
Beside the default mode, there is a set of
constructs
since version 1.6 which allow you to edit your
templates with WYSIWYG editors.

By default the template engine uses indention
for building blocks (you can turn that off).
This feature was inspired by Python and by the
need I felt to force myself
to write proper HTML-code, using proper
indentions, to make the code better readable.

Every template is customizable in multiple ways.
You can configure each
template or an entire directory to use different
delimiters, caching parameters, etc.
via either an XML-file or a XML-chunk which you
simply write anywhere inside the tpl-code.

Using the Cache the final file can also be
cached (i.e. a resulting HTML-file).
The caching options can be customized as needed.
The cache can reduce the server
load by very much, since the entire php-file
doesn't need to be processed again,
the resulting client-readable data are simply
delivered right from the cache
(the data are saved using php's output
buffering).

The template engine is prepared to be used for
multi-language applications too.
If you i.e. use the PEAR::I18N for translating
the template,
the compiled templates need to be saved under a
different name for each language.
The template engine is prepared for that too, it
saves the compiled template including the
language code if required (i.e. a compiled
index.tpl which is saved for english gets the
filename index.tpl.en.php).
