cat << EOF
This package provides a NITF XML parser. The
parser was designed with NITF version 3.1, but
should be forward-compatible when new versions
of the NITF DTD are produced. Various methods
for accessing the major elements of the
document, such as the hedline(s), byline, and
lede are provided. This class was originally
tested against the Associated Press's (AP) XML
data feed.
