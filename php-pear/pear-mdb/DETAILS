PEAR MDB is a merge of the PEAR DB and Metabase
php database abstraction layers.
It provides a common API for all support RDBMS.
The main difference to most
other DB abstraction packages is that MDB goes
much further to ensure
portability. Among other things MDB features:
* An OO-style query API
* A DSN (data source name) or array format for
specifying database servers
* Datatype abstraction and on demand datatype
conversion
* Portable error codes
* Sequential and non sequential row fetching as
well as bulk fetching
* Ordered array and associative array for the
fetched rows
* Prepare/execute (bind) emulation
* Sequence emulation
* Replace emulation
* Limited Subselect emulation
* Row limit support
* Transactions support
* Large Object support
* Index/Unique support
* Module Framework to load advanced
functionality on demand
* Table information interface
* RDBMS management methods (creating, dropping,
altering)
* RDBMS independent xml based schema definition
management
* Altering of a DB from a changed xml schema
* Reverse engineering of xml schemas from an
existing DB (currently only MySQL)
* Full integration into the PEAR Framework
* Wrappers for the PEAR DB and Metabase APIs
* PHPDoc API documentation
Currently supported RDBMS:
MySQL
PostGreSQL
Oracle
Frontbase
Querysim
Interbase/Firebird
MSSQL
