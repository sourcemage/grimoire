cat << EOF
Preference Manager is a class to handle user
preferences in a web application, looking them
up in a table
using a combination of their userid, and the
preference name to get a value, and
(optionally) returning
a default value for the preference if no value
could be found for that user.
Auth_PrefManager2 supports data containers to
allow reading/writing with different sources,
currently PEAR DB and a simple array based
container are supported, although support is
planned for an LDAP container as well. If you
don't need support for different sources, or
setting preferences for multiple applications
you should probably use Auth_PrefManager
instead.
