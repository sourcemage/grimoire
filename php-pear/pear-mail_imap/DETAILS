Mail_IMAP provides a flexible API for connecting
to and retrieving mail from mailboxes using the
IMAP, POP3 or NNTP mail protocols. Connection
to a mailbox is acheived through the c-client
extension to PHP (http://www.php.net/imap).
Meaning installation of the c-client extension
is required to use Mail_IMAP.
Mail_IMAP can be used to retrieve the contents
of a mailbox, whereas it may serve as the
backend for a webmail application or mailing
list manager.  Since Mail_IMAP is an abstracted
object, it allows for complete customization of
the UI for any application.
***NOTE***
Mail_IMAPv2 is currently available. Mail_IMAPv2
is far more extensible, has far fewer bugs than
Mail_IMAP 1, and is *not* backward compatible
with Mail_IMAP 1. Any new developement should
use Mail_IMAPv2.
