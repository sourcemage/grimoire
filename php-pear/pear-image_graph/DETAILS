Image_Graph provides a set of classes that
creates graphs/plots/charts based on
(numerical) data.
Many different plot types are supported: Bar,
line, area, step, impulse, scatter, radar, pie,
map, candlestick, band, box & whisker and
smoothed line, area and radar plots.
The graph is highly customizable, making it
possible to get the exact look and feel that is
required.
The output is controlled by a Image_Canvas,
which facilitates easy output to many different
output formats, amongst others, GD (PNG, JPEG,
GIF, WBMP), PDF (using PDFLib), Scalable Vector
Graphics (SVG).
Image_Graph is compatible with both PHP4 and
PHP5.
