cat << EOF
XML_Wddx does 2 things:
a) a drop in replacement for the XML_Wddx
extension (if it's not built in)
b) produce an editable wddx file (with
indenting etc.) and uses CDATA, rather than
char tags
This package contains 2 static method:
XML_Wddx:serialize($value)
XML_Wddx:deserialize($value)
should be 90% compatible with
wddx_deserialize(), and the deserializer will
use wddx_deserialize if it is built in..
No support for recordsets is available at
present in the PHP version of the deserializer.
