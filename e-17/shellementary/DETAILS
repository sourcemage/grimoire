Zenity replacement written in python-elementary.

It allows you to give your shell scripts a GUI - you can show several predefined
dialogs from command line, change their parameters and receive values.

Application is 95% compatible with Zenity(those 5% are unfinished features which
are in zenity and i have them in TODO).

The app has even some additional options in comparision with zenity.

Application is translatable with standard gettext .po/.mo files.
