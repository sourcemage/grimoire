What is Ecore? It is the core event abstraction layer and X abstraction layer
that makes doing selections, Xdnd, general X stuff, and event loops, timeouts
and idle handlers fast, optimized, and convenient. It's a separate library so
anyone can make use of the work put into Ecore to make this job easy for
applications.

Ecore is completely modular. At its base is the event handlers and timers, and
initialization and shutdown functions.
