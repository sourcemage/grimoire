Google Test is a framework for writing C++ tests on a variety of platforms.
Based on the xUnit architecture. Supports automatic test discovery, a rich
set of assertions, user-defined assertions, death tests, fatal and non-fatal
failures, value- and type-parameterized tests, various options for running
the tests, and XML test report generation.

Google Mock is an extension of Google Test for C++ mocking. Inspired by
jMock, EasyMock, and Hamcrest, and designed with C++'s specifics in mind,
it can help you derive better designs of your system and write better tests.
