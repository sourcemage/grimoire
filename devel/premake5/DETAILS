Premake is a command line utility which reads a scripted definition of a
software project and, most commonly, uses it to generate project files for
toolsets like Visual Studio, Xcode, or GNU Make.

Add-on modules can extend Premake with support for additional languages,
frameworks, and toolsets.

In addition to its project generation capabilities, Premake also provides
a complete Lua scripting environment, enabling the automation of complex
configuration tasks such as setting up new source tree checkouts or creating
deployment packages. These scripts will run on any platform, ending batch/shell
script duplication.

Premake is a "plain old C" application, distributed as a single executable
file. It does not require any additional libraries or runtimes to be installed,
and should build and run pretty much anywhere. It is currently being tested and
used on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and other POSIX environments. It uses only a
handful of platform dependent routines (directory management, mostly). Adding
support for additional toolsets and languages is straightforward.
