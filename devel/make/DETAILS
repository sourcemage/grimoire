make - Generates executables and other non-source programs
Make examines a set of related files, determines which of them are out
of date, and runs just the commands necessary to bring them back up to
date. Make is typically used to compile and link programs, but it can be
useful in many other situations as well.
Make reads a file called a 'makefile' to learn how the files in your
program are put together. It may also contain rules to install the
product, clear up the workspace, generate distribution packages, or
other tasks. When you write a program, you should also create a makefile
for it so that it is possible to use Make to build and install it.
