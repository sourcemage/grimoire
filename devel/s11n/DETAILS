           SHORT="A generic object serialization library for C++."
cat << EOF
s11n ("serialization") is a C++ library for easily serializing a wide
variety of objects, including PODs, STL containers, and user-defined
Serializable types. It is completely data-format agnostic and currently
supports 7 data formats, including three XML dialects and one MySQL-powered
back-end. Its author, with atypical hubris, truly believes s11n to be the
most advanced, most flexible, simplest-to-use, and utterly most powerful
serialization framework ever implemented in C++.
