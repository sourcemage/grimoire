cat << EOF
Geany is a small and lightweight integrated development environment. It was
developed to provide a small and fast IDE, which has only a few dependencies
from other packages. Another goal was to be as independent as possible from
a special Desktop Environment like KDE or GNOME.

Basic features of Geany:
 * project management
 * plugins support
 * syntax highlighting
 * code folding
 * code completion
 * auto completion of often used constructs like if, for and while
 * auto completion of XML and HTML tags
 * call tips
 * many supported filetypes like C/C++, Java, PHP, HTML, Python, Perl, Lua
 * symbol lists
