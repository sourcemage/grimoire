           SHORT="Light-weight programming language"
cat << EOF
Lua is a powerful light-weight programming language designed for extending 
applications. Lua is also frequently used as a general-purpose, stand-alone 
language.

Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description constructs
based on associative arrays and extensible semantics. Lua is dynamically typed,
interpreted from bytecodes, and has automatic memory management with garbage
collection, making it ideal for configuration, scripting, and rapid prototyping.
