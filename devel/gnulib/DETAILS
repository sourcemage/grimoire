GNU software has a well-deserved reputation for running on many different
types of systems. While our primary goal is to write software for the GNU
system, many users and developers have been introduced to us through the
systems that they were already using.

Gnulib is a central location for common GNU code, intended to be shared
among GNU packages. GCC has libiberty, but this is hard to disentangle from
the GCC build tree.

Gnulib takes a different approach. Its components are intended to be shared
at the source level, rather than being a library that gets built, installed,
and linked against. Thus, there is no distribution tarball; the idea is to
copy files from Gnulib into your own source tree.
