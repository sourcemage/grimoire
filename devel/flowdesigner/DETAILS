cat << EOF
FlowDesigner is a "data flow oriented" development environment. It can be use to build complex applications by combining small, reusable building blocks. In some way, it has similarities with Simulink and LabView, although it is not designed to be a clone of any of them. Overflow features a GUI that allows rapid application development and a visual debugger. Although Overflow can be used as a rapid prototyping tool, it can still be used for building real-time applications, such as audio effects processing. Since overflow is not really an interpreted language, it can be quite fast.
