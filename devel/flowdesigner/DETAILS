cat << EOF
FlowDesigner is a "data flow oriented" development environment. It can be
use to build complex applications by combining small, reusable building
blocks. In some way, it has similarities with Simulink and LabView, although
it is not designed to be a clone of any of them. Overflow features a GUI
that allows rapid application development and a visual debugger. Although
Overflow can be used as a rapid prototyping tool, it can still be used for
building real-time applications, such as audio effects processing. Since
overflow is not really an interpreted language, it can be quite fast.
