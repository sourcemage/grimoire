cat << EOF
This is a tool that allows you to create a database ERD in Dia (using
the UML shape toolset), then to convert that ERD into a SQL DDL script
for multiple databases. Traditionally, to be able to do these things,
you've needed to have a Win32 OS installed. But because Dia is
available for Unices, and because my Perl script works on Unices, this
means that you can now create ERDs that generate SQL DDL for your
database -- all without ever rebooting into Win32!  The best part is,
if you're a Win32 bigot, and you insist on Win32, this will still work
for you, because you can run Dia on Win32, and you can run my script
under Cygwin. DBAs should be excited about this. Everyone else has my
explicit permission to yawn.
