cat << EOF
OCamlbuild is a generic build tool, that has built-in rules for building OCaml
library and programs.

OCamlbuild's job is to determine the sequence of calls to the compiler, with
the right set of command-line flags, needed to build your OCaml-centric
software project.

In recent years, the OCaml community has converged towards a more recent and
faster build tool: Dune. If you are choosing a build system, you should probably
use Dune instead.
