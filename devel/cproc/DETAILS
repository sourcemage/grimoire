cat << EOF
cproc is a C11 compiler using QBE as a backend. It is released under the
ISC license.

Some C23 features and GNU C extensions are also implemented.

There is still much to do, but it currently implements most of the language
and is capable of building software including itself, mcpp, gcc 4.7, binutils,
and more.

It was inspired by several other small C compilers including 8cc, c, lacc,
and scc.

All architectures supported by QBE should work.
