	* DETAILS: upgrade to 2.7.20060122.0540; this file will be kept on mirrors
	  for a week or so, hopefully our mirrors will catch it during this time;
	  I upgraded to development 2.7 version because it's too hard to backport
	  ./configure options that allow enabling/disabling SWIG bindings for all
	  languages GrpahViz supports; these options however are essential because
	  without them Graphviz would fail to built with PHP present, for example;
	* DEPENDS: remove auto-tools; correct ./configure options;
	* BUILD: don't rebuild ./configure; patch for correct docs destination;
	  don't build bindings man pages if no TCL.
