The LLVM Project is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain
technologies. Despite its name, LLVM has little to do with traditional virtual
machines. The name "LLVM" itself is not an acronym; it is the full name of the
project.

LLVM began as a research project at the University of Illinois, with the goal
of providing a modern, SSA-based compilation strategy capable of supporting
both static and dynamic compilation of arbitrary programming languages. Since
then, LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of
subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of
commercial and open source projects as well as being widely used in academic
research.
