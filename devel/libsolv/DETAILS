cat << EOF
This is libsolv, a free package dependency solver using a satisfiability
algorithm.

The code is based on two major, but independent, blocks:

- Using a dictionary approach to store and retrieve package and dependency
  information in a fast and space efficient manner.

- Using satisfiability, a well known and researched topic, for resolving
  package dependencies.

The sat-solver code has been written to aim for the newest packages, record
the decision tree to provide introspection, and also provides the user with
suggestions on how to deal with unsolvable problems. It also takes advantage
of repository storage to minimize memory usage.

Supported package formats: - rpm/rpm5 - deb - arch linux - haiku

Supported repository formats: - rpmmd (primary, filelists, comps,
deltainfo/presto, updateinfo) - susetags, suse product formats -
mandriva/mageia (synthesis, info, files) - arch linux - red carpet helix
format - haiku
