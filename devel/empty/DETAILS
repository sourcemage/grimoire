cat << EOF
empty is an utility that provides an interface to execute and/or interact with
processes under pseudo-terminal sessions (PTYs). This tool is definitely useful
in programming of shell scripts designed to communicate with interactive
programs like telnet, ssh, ftp, etc. In some cases empty can be the simplest
replacement for TCL/expect or other similar programming tools because empty:
  * can be easily invoked directly from shell prompt or script
  * does not use TCL, Perl, Python or anything else as an underlying language
  * is written entirely in C
  * has small and simple source code
  * can easily be ported to almost all UNIX-like systems
