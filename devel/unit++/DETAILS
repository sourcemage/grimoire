This is homepage of unit++, a C++ unit testing framework similar to junit, yet 
intended to be more C++ like than CppUnit (the C++ port of junit).

There are at least one other thing in the project that I am proud of; a C++ 
replacement for getopt that uses a command pattern to directly execute some 
code when the option is present, rather than just return the option.
