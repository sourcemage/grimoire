reposurgeon enables risky operations that version-control systems don't
want to let you do, such as editing past comments and metadata and removing
commits. It works with any version control system that can export and
import git fast-import streams, including git, hg, fossil, bzr, CVS, and
RCS. It can also read Subversion dump files directly and can thus be used
to script production of very high-quality conversions from Subversion to
any supported DVCS.
