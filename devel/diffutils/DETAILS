A group of utilities that displays difference between and among text files.

'diff' outputs the difference between two files in any of several formats. If
the files are identical, it normally produces no ouput; if they are binary
(non-text) it normally reports only that they are different.

'cmp' shows the offsets and files numbers where two files differ; it can also
show, side by side, all the characters that differ between the two files.

'sdiff' merges two files interactively.

'diff3' shows differences among three files. If two people have made independent
changes to a common original, diff3 reports that difference between the original
and the two changed versions, and can produce a merged file that contains both
persons' changes along with warnings about conflicts.
