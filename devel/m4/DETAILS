GNU m4 - Macro processor. An implementation of the traditional UNIX macro
processor in that it copies its input to the output, expanding macros as it
goes. Macros are either built-in or user-defined and can take any number of
arguments. M4 also has built-in functions for including named files, running
UNIX commands, doing integer arithmetic, manipulating text in various ways, and
recursions. It can also be used as either a front-end to a compiler or as a
macro processor in its own right. It is often used to generate HTML as it can
give a consistent look to pages. If GNU m4 is meant to serve GNU autoconf,
beware that m4 should be fully installed *prior to* configuring autoconf itself.
