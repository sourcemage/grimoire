GNU m4 - Macro processor
An implementation of the traditional UNIX macro processor in that it
copies its input to the output, expanding macros as it goes. Macros are
either built-in or user-defined and can take any number of arguments. M4
also has built-in functions for including named files, running UNIX
commands, doing integer arithmetic, manipulating text in various ways,
and recursions.
It can also be used as either a front-end to a compiler or as a macro
processor in its own right. It is often used to generate HTML as it can
give a consistent look to pages. If GNU m4 is meant to serve GNU
autoconf, beware that m4 should be fully installed *prior to*
configuring autoconf itself.
