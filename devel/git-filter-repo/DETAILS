git filter-repo is a versatile tool for rewriting history, which includes
capabilities not found anywhere else. It roughly falls into the same space of
tool as git filter-branch but without the capitulation-inducing poor
performance, with far more capabilities, and with a design that scales
usability-wise beyond trivial rewriting cases. git filter-repo is now
recommended by the git project instead of git filter-branch.

While most users will probably just use filter-repo as a simple command line
tool (and likely only use a few of its flags), at its core filter-repo contains
a library for creating history rewriting tools. As such, users with specialized
needs can leverage it to quickly create entirely new history rewriting tools.
