cat << EOF
Sparse, the semantic parser, provides a compiler frontend capable of
parsing most of ANSI C as well as many GCC extensions, and a collection
of sample compiler backends, including a static analyzer also called
"sparse". Sparse provides a set of annotations designed to convey
semantic information about types, such as what address space pointers
point to, or what locks a function acquires or releases.
