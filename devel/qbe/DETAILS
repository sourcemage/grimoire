cat << EOF
QBE aims to be a pure C embeddable backend that provides 70% of the performance
of advanced compilers in 10% of the code. Its small size serves both its
aspirations of correctness and our ability to understand, fix, and improve
it. It also serves its users by providing trivial integration and great
flexibility.
