cat << EOF
prelink is a program which modifies ELF shared libraries and ELF 
dynamically linked binaries, so that the time which dynamic linker needs 
for their relocation at startup significantly decreases and also due to 
fewer relocations the run-time memory consumption decreases too 
(especially number of unshareable pages). Such prelinking information is 
only used if all its dependent libraries have not changed since 
prelinking, otherwise programs are relocated normally.
