Callgrind uses runtime instrumentation via the Valgrind framework for its cache
simulation and call-graph generation. This way, even shared libraries and 
dynamically opened plugins can be profiled. The data files generated by 
Callgrind can be loaded into KCachegrind for browsing the performance results.
But there is also a command line tool in the package to get ASCII reports from 
data files without the need to use KCachegrind.
