ImHex is a Hex Editor, a tool to display, decode and analyze binary data to
reverse engineer their format, extract informations or patch values in them.

What makes ImHex special is that it has many advanced features that can often
only be found in paid applications. Such features are a completely custom
binary template and pattern language to decode and highlight structures in
the data, a graphical node-based data processor to pre-process values before
they're displayed, a disassembler, diffing support, bookmarks and much much
more. At the same time ImHex is completely free and open source under the GPLv2
license.
