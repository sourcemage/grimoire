Yabasic is a traditional basic-interpreter. It comes with goto and various
loops and allows to define subroutines and libraries. It does simple graphics
and printing. Yabasic can call out to libraries written in C and allows to
create standalone programs. Yabasic runs under Unix and Windows and has a
comprehensive documentation; it is small, simple, open-source and free.
