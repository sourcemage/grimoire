cat << EOF
Dune is a build system for OCaml projects. Using it, you can build executables,
libraries, run tests, and much more.

* Dune knows OCaml and its ecosystem:
  Dune has rules that precisely capture how the OCaml toolchain works. It is
  able to interoperate with most of the existing tools like OPAM, merlin,
  reason, and js_of_ocaml.

* Dune is fast:
  Dune works hard to do things once and in parallel, so both cold and
  incremental builds are way faster than traditional build systems.

* Dune is widely used:
  Dune is used in both large projects and small libraries. About 40% of OPAM
  packages are built using Dune.
