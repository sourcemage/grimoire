cat << EOF
GNU GLOBAL is a source code tagging system that works the same way across
diverse environments (emacs, vi, less, bash, web browser, etc). You can locate
objects in source files and move there easily. It is useful for hacking a
large project containing many subdirectories, many #ifdef and many main()
functions. It is similar to ctags or etags but is different from them at
the point of independence of any editor. It runs on a UNIX(POSIX) compatible
operating system like GNU and BSD.
