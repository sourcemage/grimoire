Z88DK is a collection of software development tools that targets the 8080
and z80 family of machines. It allows development of programs in C, assembly
language or any mixture of the two. What makes z88dk unique is its ease of
use, built-in support for many z80 machines and its extensive set of assembly
language library subroutines implementing the C standard and extensions.
