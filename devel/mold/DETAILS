cat << EOF
mold is a faster drop-in replacement for existing Unix linkers. It is several
times faster than LLVM lld linker, the second-fastest open-source linker which
I originally created a few years ago. mold is created for increasing developer
productivity by reducing build time especially in rapid debug-edit-rebuild
cycles.
