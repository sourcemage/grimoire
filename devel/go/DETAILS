Go is simple.
Go is type safe and memory safe.  Go has pointers but no pointer
arithmetic.  For random access, use slices, which know their limits.
Go promotes writing systems and servers as sets of lightweight
communicating processes, called goroutines, with strong support from
the language.  Run thousands of goroutines if you want—and say
good-bye to stack overflows.
Go has fast builds, clean syntax, garbage collection, methods for any
type, and run-time reflection.  It feels like a dynamic language but
has the speed and safety of a static language.  It's a joy to use.
