Smake is a highly portable make program with automake features.  It is
targeted to be used with the makefiles system as well as with any general
purpose make task.

makefiles allows to mount a source tree via NFS and simultaneous compilation
on all supported platforms makefiles therefore allows to re-use a source
tree for all supported platforms in favor of the GNU concept of untar ->
configure -> make -> install -> remove

makefiles is best used with smake for convenience and easier debugging
because gnu make does not run on all platforms smake does and because gnu
make does not allow to do Makefile debugging

Since smake-1.2a26, smake includes a general set of built in default make
rules, this allows smake to be used as a general purpose make program.
