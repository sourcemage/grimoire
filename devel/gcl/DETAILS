           SHORT="GNU Compiler and interpreter for Common Lisp"
cat << EOF
GNU Common Lisp (GCL, formerly known as Austin Kyoto Common Lisp) is 
a compiler and interpreter for Common Lisp. GCL is very portable and 
extremely efficient on a wide class of applications, and compares 
favorably in performance with commercial Lisps on several large 
theorem--prover and symbolic algebra systems. GCL supports the CLtL1 
specification.

Some advantages

    * GCL compiles to C and then uses the native optimizing C compiler 
      (e.g., GCC), giving great portability.
    * Highly efficient. A function call is basically the same speed as
      a C function call, in fact identical to a C function call via a 
      pointer.
    * It has a source level Lisp debugger (dbl) for interpreted code, 
      letting you step a line at a time, while displaying the your 
      position in an Emacs window. This is invaluable when trying to 
      understand large systems.
    * Has pioneered conservative Garbage Collection schemes.
    * Also has a garbage collection scheme, for only recent allocations, 
      based on native page fault handling. This is the stratified 
      garbage collection (SGC).
    * Very reliable. People have huge chip verification suites which 
      run for extended periods. I have had computations which ran for 
      weeks. There are no leaks.
    * Very fast. I have numerous users who claim their code runs two 
      times under GCL, than in competitive lisps.
    * New features such as fast regexp matching (using my new algorithm).
    * Socket code is being added.
    * A new Windows 95 port is in progress.
    * Can be used in commercial applications, since covered by the 
      Gnu library license, which permits you to distribute a system 
      including GCL, as long as you distribute your binary .o files as 
      well.
    * built in interface to Tk widget system. Allows a mixture of tcl 
      and common lisp to be used in a user interface--your choice which 
      you use.
    * Special permission can be given for other commercial applications.
    * Support available from the developer.
