X servers (including Xorg, Xwayland, Xvfb, Xnest & Xdmx), the core of the X
Window System.

The X server accepts requests from client release-service to create windows,
which are (normally rectangular) "virtual screens" that the client program
can draw into.

Windows are then composed on the actual screen by the X server
(or by a separate composite manager) as directed by the window manager,
which usually communicates with the user via graphical controls such as buttons
and draggable titlebars and borders.
