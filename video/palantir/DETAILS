Palantir is a client-server streaming system designed to transmit live video, audio and
data over a TCP/IP network, as well as to control remote devices.
It is named after a word invented by J. R. R. Tolkien and mentioned in his tales, whose
meaning is far-seer. The correct pronounciation requires the "i" in "tir" to be accented.
