cat << EOF
Work on mplay was motivated by experience of other console based audio players.
Although mplay is a front-end to MPlayer, it extends its functions in several
significant ways. It:

* keeps a browsable , sortable and searchable playlist
* provides an internal filebrowser to add files
* provides essential status information
* includes a progress bar
* remembers the position within the track last played before quitting
* shows ID3-info / tag and it is possible to edit ID3-tag
* gives user-friendly output through a colour scheme
* runs as single-instance (provides basic controlling from outside)
* provides basic mixer functions * provides an own interactive shoutcast
  streambrowser
* interactive help (German/English) for control keys
* mouse support
* jump to track, jump to time-position(very useful for http-streams)
* plays various http-streams
