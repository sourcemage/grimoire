 Lumiere is a GNOME frontend to mplayer the great movie player for *nix.

Mplayer is really good, but unfortunately it is a bit difficult to use because it is a command line only (mostly, if you want most options...) program. I wanted to integrate it into the GNOME as a Bonobo component so that I could preview, or even view media files (mostly videos) from within the Nautilus file manager.
