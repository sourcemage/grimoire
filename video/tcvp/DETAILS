TCVP is a video and music player, transcoder and streaming server for Unix-like
operating systems.
A key feature of TCVP is its modular design. The whole functionality is broken
down into a set of modules, each with a clean, well-defined interface. This
allows for easy extensibility, as well as possibility to reuse parts of TCVP in
other applications.
