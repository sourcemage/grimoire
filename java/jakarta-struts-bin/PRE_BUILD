# PRE_BUILD for rejected spells
#
# Modified 2002 Aug 23 05:10 by Derek Moyes <sorcerer@flamesnyper.com>
#   Default behavior changed to NOT AUTOMATICALLY install or update rejected
#     spells. This prevents silly third-party install scripts from halting a
#     sorcery update, while waiting for input.
#   Added test for UNATTEND_SAFE placeholder file in the spell. This file skips
#     the warning altogether & allows the spell to cast automatically. Simply
#     create an empty file named UNATTEND_SAFE in the spell's directory.
#   Check if spell installed routine added (thx to dufflebunk for bash help).
#   Comments added for future BASHers.
#   Warning text clarified & expanded.
#   Sorcery colors added.

# Test if spell is already installed.
