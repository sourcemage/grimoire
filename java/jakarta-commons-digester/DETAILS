Basically, the Digester package lets you configure an XML -> Java
object mapping module, which triggers certain actions called rules
whenever a particular pattern of nested XML elements is recognized.
A rich set of predefined rules is available for your use, or you 
can also create your own. Advanced features of Digester include:

  * Ability to plug in your own pattern matching engine, if the 
    standard one is not sufficient for your requirements.
  * Optional namespace-aware processing, so that you can define 
    rules that are relevant only to a particular XML namespace.
  * Encapsulation of Rules into RuleSets that can be easily and
    conveniently reused in more than one application that requires 
    the same type of processing.
