Ever wanted to get rid of Outlook? DavMail is a
POP/IMAP/SMTP/Caldav/Carddav/LDAP exchange gateway allowing users to use any
mail/calendar client (e.g. Thunderbird with Lightning or Apple iCal) with an
Exchange server, even from the internet or behind a firewall through Outlook
Web Access. DavMail now includes an LDAP gateway to Exchange global address
book and user personal contacts to allow recipient address completion in mail
compose window and full calendar support with attendees free/busy display.

DavMail also supports the CardDav protocol to sync address books. This new
feature is sponsored by French Defense / DGA through project Trustedbird.

The main goal of DavMail is to provide standard compliant protocols in front of
proprietary Exchange. This means LDAP for global address book, SMTP to send
messages, IMAP to browse messages on the server in any folder, POP to retrieve
inbox messages only, Caldav for calendar support and Carddav for personal
contacts sync. Thus any standard compliant client can be used with Microsoft
Exchange.

DavMail gateway is implemented in java and should run on any platform. Releases
are tested on Windows, Linux (Ubuntu) and Mac OSX. Tested successfully with the
Iphone (gateway running on a server).
