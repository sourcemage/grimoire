Clam AntiVirus is an anti-virus toolkit for Unix. The main purpose 
of this software is the integration with mail servers (attachment 
scanning). The package provides a flexible and scalable 
multi-threaded daemon, a commandline scanner, and a tool for 
automatic updating via Internet. The programs are based on a shared 
library distributed with the Clam AntiVirus package, which you can 
use in your own software.
