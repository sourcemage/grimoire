# This file contains the options used in the SeaMonkey build. You may
# need to specify additional options for your specific build needs.
# Use the information provided by running './configure --help' to
# help you determine if you need to add any additional options.
# Some additional options can be added by uncommenting the examples
# in this file or adding options by inserting a line containing
# 'ac_add_options --some-option-you-need'.


# Create an object directory and specify to build the package in that
# directory. If desired, modify the location of the object directory
# to a directory inside the source tree by removing '../' from the
# line below.
mk_add_options MOZ_OBJDIR=@TOPSRCDIR@/seamonkey-build
mk_add_options AUTOCONF=autoconf2.13

# This option is used to specify that the SeaMonkey suite is
# being built and to use all the default options for SeaMonkey.
ac_add_options --enable-application=suite

# Specify the installation prefix. If you would prefer SeaMonkey
# installed in a different prefix, modify the line below to fit
# your needs. You'll also need to modify some of the instructions in
# the BLFS book to point to your desired prefix.
ac_add_options --prefix=/usr

# These options are used so that the SeaMonkey binaries are linked to
# the system-installed copies of the specified libraries instead of
# the source tree code which may not be the most recent versions.
ac_add_options --with-system-zlib
ac_add_options --without-system-png
ac_add_options --with-system-jpeg

# This option specifies to include support for rendering the HTML
# <canvas></canvas> tag in the SeaMonkey browser.
ac_add_options --enable-canvas

# This option is added so that test libraries and programs are not
# built. These would only be required for debugging purposes.
ac_add_options --disable-tests

# This option is added so that the Mozilla Installer program is not
# built or installed. The program is not required for a BLFS
# installation of SeaMonkey.
ac_add_options --disable-installer

# This option is used to disable the a11y support in the SeaMonkey
# binaries. Comment out this option if you require a11y support.
ac_add_options --disable-accessibility

# This option is used to enable support for rendering SVG files in the
# SeaMonkey browser.
ac_add_options --enable-svg

# This option is used to enable source tree included LDAP support in
# the SeaMonkey binaries.
ac_add_options --enable-ldap

# Uncomment this option if you desire support for dual-monitor
# display of SeaMonkey using the X-Window Xinerama libraries.
#ac_add_options --enable-xinerama

# Complex scripts such as Thai can only be rendered in SeaMonkey with the
# help of Pango. This option significantly slows rendering, so only use
# it if necessary.
#ac_add_options --enable-pango

# This option identifies the default binary directory of the SeaMonkey
# installation and is used to locate SeaMonkey's installed files. This
# option is not required for end-user browsing, and is only used for
# development purposes.
ac_add_options --with-default-mozilla-five-home=/usr/lib/seamonkey

# These two options enable support for building SeaMonkey with
# system-installed versions of the Network Security Services (NSS)
# and Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR) libraries. Uncomment both
# lines to enable support for system-installed NSS/NSPR.
ac_add_options --with-system-nspr
ac_add_options --with-system-nss
ac_add_options --enable-crypto
