cat << EOF
VMOD using the synchronous hiredis library API to access Redis servers from VCL.

Highlights:
 o Full support for execution of LUA scripts (i.e. EVAL command), including
   optimistic automatic execution of EVALSHA commands.
 o All Redis reply data types are supported, including partial support to
   access to components of simple (i.e. not nested) array replies.
 o Redis pipelines are not (and won't be) supported. LUA scripting, which is
   fully supported by the VMOD, it's a much more flexible alternative to
   pipelines for atomic execution and minimizing latency. Pipelines are hard to
   use and error prone, specially when using the WATCH command.
 o Support for classic Redis deployments using multiple replicated Redis
   servers and for clustered deployments based on Redis Cluster.
 o Support for multiple databases and multiple Redis connections, local to each
   Varnish worker thread, or shared using one or more pools.
 o Support for smart command execution, selecting the destination server
   according with the preferred role (i.e. master or slave) and with distance
   and healthiness metrics collected during execution.
 o Support for Redis Sentinel, allowing automatic discovery of sick / healthy
   servers and changes in their roles.
