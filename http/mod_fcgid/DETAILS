mod_fcgid is a high performance alternative to mod_cgi or mod_cgid, which
starts
a sufficient number of instances of the CGI program to handle concurrent
requests,
and these programs remain running to handle further incoming requests. It is
favored by the PHP developers, for example, as a preferred alternative
to running
mod_php in-process, delivering very similar performance.
