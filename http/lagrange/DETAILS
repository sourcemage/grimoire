Lagrange is a desktop GUI client for browsing Geminispace. It offers modern
conveniences familiar from web browsers, such as smooth scrolling, inline
image viewing, multiple tabs, visual themes, Unicode fonts, bookmarks,
history, and page outlines.

Like Gemini, Lagrange has been designed with minimalism in mind. It depends
on a small number of essential libraries. It is written in C and uses SDL
for hardware-accelerated graphics. OpenSSL is used for secure communications.
