xs-httpd is a WWW server that has the following features:

* It is pronounced as "access HTTP daemon" 
* It is small (very small in fact: a factor two to three smaller than normal
  servers on disk and in memory) 
* It is fast (because it is so small and does not do unnecessary things) 
* Uses very little CPU time 
* Configurable (extensive configuration options for admins and users) 
* Runs user CGI binaries under their own user ID! 
* Gets users' pages under their own user ID, allowing them to really have
  protected pages (when combined with the built-in authentication mechanism) 
* Does not fork for every connection (has a fixed number of servers) 
* Comes with some other useful programs 
* Offers Server-Side Includes for many common tasks, including built-in page
  counters (text or graphical) 
* Supports PHP and other interpreted file formats 
* Supports automatic decompression to save diskspace and bandwidth 
* Serves SSL (https) and http connections through the same daemon 
* Supports SSL client certificates (as means of authentication) 
* Full support for IPv6 
* Available under BSD license (since version 3.5)
