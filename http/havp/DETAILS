cat << EOF
HAVP is a proxy with an anti-virus filter. It does not cache
or filter content. At the moment the complete traffic is
scanned. A reason for that is the chance of malicious code
in nearly every filetypes e.g. HTML (JavaScript) or Jpeg. I
hope to stop especially dialer or browser exploits. But
writing a http Anti Virus Proxy is a dilemma! Hugh downloads
are a problem for virus scanning proxies. A Client should
not receive data which is unchecked by the virus scanner,
but big download must not timeout.

HAVP requires hard locking to be enabled on the file system
where files are temporary stored for scanning. See mount(8)
option "mand," e.g.
http://www.tin.org/bin/man.cgi?section=8&topic=mount.

HAVP can be integrated with Squid Web cache, see
