cat << EOF
httptunnel creates a bidirectional virtual data 
connection tunnelled in HTTP requests. The HTTP 
requests can be sent via an HTTP proxy if so desired. 

This can be useful for users behind restrictive 
firewalls. If WWW access is allowed through a HTTP 
proxy, it's possible to use httptunnel and, say, telnet 
or PPP to connect to a computer outside the firewall.
