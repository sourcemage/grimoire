cat << EOF
Middleman is a fast HTTP/HTTPS proxy server with features designed to remove
unwanted content and increase privacy. It features an XML-like configuration
file and an intuitive Web interface. It can be used to filter HTTP headers,
block certain files or mime types, block cookies to and from certain sites,
redirect requests, forward requests through another proxy using NTLM or Basic
authentication, block inappropiate content using a keyword scoring system, and
manipulate the contents of files using either its builtin rewrite feature or an
external program or script. It fully implements the HTTP/1.1 protocol,
including persistent connections and gzip encoding.
